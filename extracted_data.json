        "notes": "Location:\n- The project is located in Gda\u0144sk, Poland, where Northvolt Dwa has assembled its first energy storage system (ESS) products as part of its commissioning process. \n\nCapacity:\n- The new 25,000 square meter plant in Gda\u0144sk assembles cells into battery systems for customers in energy storage and industrial markets. The current operational capacity is not specified.\n\nInvestment amounts:\n- The company has raised $1.2 billion in an extension of the $1.1 billion convertible note signed in July 2022. The investment comes from funds labeled dark green in accordance with Article 9 of the EU's Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation. The European Innovation Fund has also provided support for the project. In total, Northvolt has secured over $9 billion in equity and debt.\n\nProject progress:\n- Northvolt Dwa has assembled its first energy storage system (ESS) products in Gda\u0144sk, Poland, and is in the final validation of production lines. Customer deliveries are expected to commence later in the year.\n\nProject type:\n- The project involves the construction of a new 25,000 square meter plant in Gda\u0144sk, Poland, to assemble cells into battery systems for energy storage and industrial markets.\n\nValue chain stages:\n- The facility covers the stages of cell fabrication, where cathode and anode are combined with an electrolyte, and module assembly.\n\nAdditional notes:\n- Battery cells are designed and developed at Northvolt Labs in V\u00e4ster\u00e5s, Sweden, and Northvolt Cuberg in San Leandro, California, US. Battery cell manufacturing is ramping up at Northvolt Ett gigafactory in Skellefte\u00e5, Sweden, and an adjacent giga-scale recycling plant, Revolt Ett, is due to start operations later this year. Additional projects are under development in Sweden, Germany, and Portugal."
