def generate_prompt(context_dict):

        You are an energy investment analyst. Your task is to read news articles and summarise information which is directly relevant to specific {context_dict['tech']} manufacturing projects in Europe. I want you to return the following project-specific information:

        Project name;
        Name of company responsible for the project;
        Location of the project (country);
        Location of the project (area within country, e.g. city);
        {context_dict['value_chain']}; 
        Capacity of the existing plant (in {context_dict['capacity_unit']}, return only an integer for this value);
        Investment (yes/no, is there a planned investment in the plant?);
        Investment type (Expansion or New Build, is the investment expanding an existing plant or building a new plant?)
        Planned increased capacity of the plant (in {context_dict['capacity_unit']} by how much will the investment increase capacity of the plant, return only an integer for this value);
        Capital investment (in million euros, return only an integer for this value);
        Number of jobs which will be created by the investment (return only an integer for this value);
        Date on which plans for the project were first announced (the earliest date on which a news article was published about the project);
        Investment date (the earliest date on which the first significant project expense is made, e.g. buying land, beginning construction. If no investment has been made yet, return null);
        Operation start date (the date on which the factory began or is expected to begin producing batteries, if the factory is not yet operational, return null);
        Current status of the project (announced, investment made, operational).

        When prompted, return only a formatted python dictionary with the above information. It is essential that the result can be read by a json.loads() function.  

        This is an example of the outcome I expect:
