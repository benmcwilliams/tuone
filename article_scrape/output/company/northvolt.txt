Article 4: {'title': 'Northvolt rolls out Europe’s first ‘gigafactory-era’ car battery', 'text': 'Electric cars have gone mainstream in Europe – they accounted for nearly a fifth of all car purchases in the UK last month. Yet one piece has been missing up to now: European batteries.\n\nThat is now changing. On Tuesday night, Northvolt, a startup, produced its first lithium ion battery cell at a plant in northern Sweden. It is the first of a series of new factories that investors hope will allow Europe to carve out a big proportion of the electric vehicle market – and weaken the stranglehold built up by manufacturers in China, Japan and Korea.\n\nThe Northvolt Ett site will be the first European-owned plant to produce at so-called gigafactory scale. Gigafactories are generally considered to be those capable of producing enough batteries each year to provide about 15 gigawatt hours (GWh) of cumulative storage.\n\nOnly two large battery factories are operational in Europe, according to Benchmark Mineral Intelligence (BMI), a battery data company: a factory in Wrocław, Poland, run by Korea’s LG, and another owned by Korea’s Samsung near Budapest in Hungary.\n\nYet there are 25 gigafactories planned for the continent by 2030, according to BMI, as the industry races to keep up with soaring demand for electric cars. Nine of those are owned by Asian manufacturers, which control most of the global supply.\n\nThe UK is arguably further behind the rest of Europe, with plans for only two gigafactories. One will be a major expansion of a small battery plant in Sunderland by the Chinese company Envision, while the Glencore-backed startup Britishvolt is attempting to secure funding for a homegrown rival in nearby Blyth.\n\nLocal authorities in Coventry are trying to find a manufacturer for a third site at the local airport, but nobody has yet stepped forward – a situation that has cast a shadow over the prospects of the UK automotive sector as it strives to replace the declining internal combustion engine industry.\n\nSimon Moores, BMI’s chief executive, hailed Northvolt’s first cell as “Europe’s first gigafactory-era lithium ion battery”.\n\nDespite its startup status, Northvolt has gained heavyweight financial backing from Volkswagen, the world’s biggest car producer, and the investment bank Goldman Sachs. Its $2.75bn (£2.1bn) funding round in June valued it at $12bn.\n\nNorthvolt hopes to rapidly expand production at the plant at Skellefteå in northern Sweden to produce 60GWh a year – enough to supply batteries for a million electric cars. Commercial deliveries will start in the new year.\n\nSign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk\n\nThe startup already boasts contracts worth $30bn with big European companies including the carmakers BMW, Volkswagen, Volvo Cars and Polestar, the truck manufacturer Scania, and the energy storage firm Fluence. Carmakers are belatedly ramping up electric vehicle production to meet tightening emissions targets as well as the challenge from their US rival, Tesla, which has built its own battery and car plant in Berlin.\n\nPeter Carlsson, Northvolt’s chief executive and co-founder, said the production of the lithium ion battery on Tuesday represented“a great milestone”.\n\n“Of course, this first cell is only the beginning,” he said. “Over the course of the coming years, we look forward to Northvolt Ett expanding its production capacity greatly to enable the European transition to clean energy.”', 'published_date': '2021-12-29 00:00:00', 'keywords': []}...

Article 7: {'title': 'Northvolt to build third gigafactory in northern Germany', 'text': 'Northvolt signs Memorandum of Understanding with the north German state of Schleswig-Holstein and the region of Heide for the development of a 60 GWh lithium-ion battery manufacturing plant\n\nThe gigafactory, Northvolt Drei, is to employ 3,000 persons and produce its first batteries in late 2025\n\nPowered by the cleanest electricity grid in Germany, Northvolt Drei is positioned to produce the cleanest batteries in continental Europe\n\nStockholm/Heide â\x80\x93 Today Northvolt announces its intention to establish a battery gigafactory in Heide, Schleswig-Holstein, northern Germany. With an annual potential production capacity of 60 GWh, Northvolt Drei will deliver a supply of sustainably produced lithium-ion batteries to the European market, sufficient for some one million electric vehicles.\n\nThe new gigafactory increases Northvoltâ\x80\x99s pipeline of battery manufacturing capacity under development to over 170 GWh, thereby advancing the company on its mission to deliver batteries in a manner characterized by clean energy and circularity that is fundamentally different from approaches dominating the global industry today.\n\nPeter Carlsson, Co-Founder and CEO of Northvolt, comments: â\x80\x9cWeâ\x80\x99re excited to announce Northvolt Drei â\x80\x93 a project which fits well into a promising future cluster of clean technology ventures emerging in northern Germany and advances the wider European transition towards a sustainable society within which Germany plays a crucial role.â\x80\x9d\n\nEnvisioned to produce its first batteries in 2025 and provide some 3,000 new jobs, a central intention of Northvolt Drei is to deliver high-performance lithium-ion batteries, produced with the lowest environmental footprint in continental Europe.\n\nThe selection of Heide, Schleswig-Holstein, is key to fulfilment of this objective. The region hosts the cleanest energy grid in Germany, one which is characterized by a surplus of electricity generated by onshore and offshore wind power and reinforced by clean energy provided through grid interconnections to Denmark and Norway.\n\nâ\x80\x9cIt matters how we produce a battery cell. If you use coal in your production, you embed a fair amount of CO2 into your battery, but if we use clean energy, we can build a very sustainable product. Our philosophy is that new energy-intensive industries, such as battery manufacturing, should be established in actual geographical proximity to where the clean energy is produced,â\x80\x9d says Peter Carlsson.\n\nIt is not only an abundance of clean energy which positions the region of Heide and broader industrial landscape surrounding Hamburg as ideally suited to hosting Northvoltâ\x80\x99s expanding presence in Europe.\n\nIn addition to being centrally positioned in the emerging European battery supply chain connecting Scandinavia and continental Europe, the region also provides the space required to establish a battery plant of sufficient size to leverage the economies of scale in production which are key to reducing battery costs.\n\nAccess to German industrial competence and automotive expertise will provide additional opportunities. Local manufacturing expertise of the Schleswig-Holstein region and Heide will ensure the factory is delivering batteries of the highest quality, while the factory itself will provide critical labor force experience with battery technology â\x80\x93 an emerging cornerstone technology of the European economy.\n\nWith sustainability at the forefront of design and decision-making surrounding Northvolt Drei, the factory will source significant volumes of its raw material requirements from recycled battery metals, as part of Northvoltâ\x80\x99s commitment to source 50 percent of its raw material needs from recycling by 2030.\n\nAlongside battery production, Northvolt Drei will target an on-site battery recycling plant which will ensure efficient reuse of byproducts from the production process and provide a sustainable solution for end-of-life electric vehicle batteries recovered from European markets.\n\nAcross the full scope of the project, Northvolt is eager to bring the companyâ\x80\x99s commitment to transparency and straightforwardness into its dealings with external stakeholders. That approach has proven successful in Sweden, in Norway and in Poland, and there is every reason to believe it will underpin delivery of another project with Northvolt Drei.\n\nChristofer Haux, interim CEO of Northvolt Drei, comments: â\x80\x9cWe look forward to engaging with communities and authorities of Schleswig-Holstein to ensure that Northvolt Drei is developed in a transparent and collaborative manner that makes the most of the many opportunities the project represents for the region.â\x80\x9d\n\nRead more about a future career at Northvolt Drei.\n\nAbout Northvolt\n\nNorthvolt is a European supplier of sustainable, high-quality battery cells and systems.

I hope that todayâ\x80\x99s event and the signing of our EUR 52.5 million loan contract with Northvolt will also help catalyse a number of similar investments across other EU Member States," said Vice-President Andrew McDowell of the EIB.\n\nThe facility will be built in VÃ¤sterÃ¥s, outside of Stockholm, Sweden. VÃ¤sterÃ¥s is home to several multinational companies with world class engineering and R&D competence in electrification and process optimization.\n\n"It is not a coincidence that this ground-breaking investment takes place in Sweden. We have excellent conditions to host the battery factories of tomorrow. We have the potential for mining of key minerals, green electricity and automation and power competence needed to make it happen. Sustainability and green technology is not just about doing good. It is about doing good business. And staying competitive in the long run," said Mikael Damberg, Swedish Minister of Enterprise and Innovation.\n\nWith the mission to enable the transition to renewable energy and electrification, Northvolt in March 2017 launched its plans to build Europeâ\x80\x99s largest lithium-ion battery cell factory. During the past 12 months significant progress has been made towards achieving the goal.\n\n"Northvolt is now entering the next phase, going from a planning to a physical phase. With a number of key partners and customers onboard, and with major progress made within cell, product and process development, we are now ready to take the next step," said Peter Carlsson.\n\nMilestones\n\nSite selection:\n\nAfter conducting an in-depth assessment spanning over six months of ten potential factory locations in Sweden and Finland, Northvolt announced a partnership with two Swedish municipalities for the establishment of Northvolt Labs in VÃ¤sterÃ¥s and Northvoltâ\x80\x99s first large-scale battery factory in SkellefteÃ¥.\n\nEnvironmental permits:\n\nNorthvolt has, well ahead of schedule, received the environmental permit for the Northvolt Labs operations in VÃ¤sterÃ¥s and is in final negotiations around the permit for the large-scale manufacturing facility in SkellefteÃ¥.\n\nStrategic partnerships:\n\nNorthvolt has since launch entered into strategic industrial partnerships with ABB, Vestas and Scania. The company today announced two new partnerships with Canadian lithium supplier Nemaska Lithium and Japanese battery production equipment manufacturer SECI.\n\nBattery systems:\n\nDriven by customer demand, a unit called Northvolt Battery Systems has been established â\x80\x93 a team dedicated to developing complete battery systems, which includes cells, battery, data management systems and thermal control functions, for key customer segments. The first battery module prototype was completed in February of this year. Northvolt today announced it has been selected by Epiroc as a supplier of battery systems for zero-emissions mining machines.\n\nCell design:\n\nMajor strides have been made in cell design. Based on the highest industry standards, which will be implemented in every step of the manufacturing process, the Northvolt cell design team delivered the first test cell earlier this year.\n\nRecycling:\n\nA recycling program has been initiated with Chalmers University with the aim to industrialize the recycling process of lithium-ion batteries. By dismantling and recycling raw materials on elementary level, Northvolt believes that resources can be taken care of and prepared to the quality level of primary material to reintroduce in the production line.\n\nSupplier relationships:\n\nNorthvolt has developed extensive relationships with key suppliers all around the world. These relationships have enabled the team, as a first step already before the establishment of Northvolt Labs, to develop a decentralized demoline on-site at each supplierâ\x80\x99s facility to initiate R&D projects in order to test machines, processes and products.\n\nRaw materials:\n\nNorthvolt has a clear roadmap to source a responsibly mined, clean and secure feed of material. Northvolt today announced the formation of a strategic partnership for the supply of battery grade lithium hydroxide with Nemaska Lithium Inc.\n\nTeam:\n\nThe Northvolt team has grown from 12 people at launch to over 100 people today. The team has 27 different nationalities and people with backgrounds from a broad array of companies, such as Scania, Tesla, McKinsey, ABB and Renault Nissan.\n\nFinancing:\n\nNorthvolt last year initiated a fundraising round with the ambition to raise up to EUR 100 million to finance the launch of Northvolt Labs. Those funds have been secured and exceeded. The team will later this year initiate a larger funding round to support the establishment of the first part of the large-scale factory in SkellefteÃ¥.\n\nThe EU Battery Alliance:\n\nAfter an initiative from MaroÅ¡ Å efÄ\x8dovic, Vice-President for the Energy Union in the European Commission, the industry led EU Battery Alliance was formed during the fall. The alliance will work to create a comprehensive, European-wide, roadmap for battery manufacturing. Northvolt has been an active part of the EU Battery Alliance from the very beginning, and will continue to contribute towards this initiative in order ensure continued European competitiveness.\n\nFacts sheet: Northvolt Labs\n\nNorthvolt Labs is a cutting edge scale-up line and research facility used to develop, test and industrialize lithium-ion battery cells before large-scale production. The facility will enable fully process representative manufacturing and allow a faster and more efficient time to market for unique formulations, cell formats and technology. At Northvolt Labs, Northvolt will be able to fully validate product and process development, from active material for finished cell, for multiple form factors.', 'published_date': '2021-04-29 19:35:31+00:00', 'keywords': []}...
