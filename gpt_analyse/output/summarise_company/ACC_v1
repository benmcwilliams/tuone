In 2021, Meyer Burger initiated a 400MW solar cell and module capacity project that is planned to expand to 1.4GW for solar cells and 1GW for modules by 2022, with a long-term goal of reaching a production volume of 5GW per year. This project aims to revitalize solar PV manufacturing in Europe using advanced PV technology. Additionally, the European Solar Manufacturing Council (ESMC) has proposed the need for a new Solar Strategy that addresses the situation of PV manufacturing, aiming to reduce supply disruptions and quality risks. Furthermore, the ESMC initiated the PV-IPCEI framework for PV manufacturing in cooperation with partner organizations of the European Solar Initiative, with the goal of securing at least 20GW of sustainably competitive PV manufacturing capacities in the EU by 2025, scaling up to 100GW by 2030, and representing at least 15% of the global market share. 

Announcements were made in July 2021 regarding Germany's Meyer Burger's production capacities, as well as the European Solar Manufacturing Council's proposal. In addition to these announcements, the European Solar Manufacturing Council has already joined the PV-IPCEI initiative and works are ongoing in five IPCEI Project Groups.

There is also information about various capacity expansion plans communicated by different companies, focusing on projects in Germany, Spain, Italy, Portugal, Russia, Poland, the Netherlands, and Romania. These projects aim to establish a booming, sustainable industry with investments earmarked, factories planned, and political strategies outlined. These expansions will contribute to strengthening wafer, cell, and module production in Europe, ultimately making the region more self-reliable in solar manufacturing.
