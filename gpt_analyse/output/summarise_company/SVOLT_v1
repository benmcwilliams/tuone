SVOLT Energy Technology Co has announced plans to expand its footprint in Europe by building up to five factories, with one larger site having a capacity of 20 gigawatts. The company is targeting a production capacity of at least 50 gigawatt-hours in Europe by the end of the decade. SVOLT unveiled plans to build an additional cell assembly in Germany and a plant in Saarland. The company is also in talks with several European car makers about battery cell supply agreements. The announcements were made in April 2023 as reported by Bloomberg News. These projects are currently in the planning and announcement stage.

The European Solar-PV Industry Alliance aims to accelerate solar PV deployment in the EU by scaling up to 30 GW of annual solar PV manufacturing capacity in Europe by 2025.

SVOLT's manufacturing projects in Europe align with the EU's goal of creating a competitive solar-PV supply chain in Europe and the ambition to secure and diversify supplies of solar PV products. SVOLT will need to focus on achieving scale, excellence, and the deployment of leading technology to be competitive in the European market. Additionally, the company could benefit from potential consumer willingness to pay a premium for European-made panels, as well as the lower embedded carbon footprint of European products. However, the company will face challenges in building a competitive ecosystem of suppliers and equipment providers and mitigating cost disadvantages compared to existing industry leaders. The EU's market design and regulatory framework will play a critical role in de-risking investments in the region.
