Northvolt, a Swedish battery supplier, is involved in multiple battery manufacturing projects in Europe:

1. Northvolt is expanding its battery systems capabilities in Gdańsk, Poland, with a new factory that will have an initial annual output of 5 GWh and a potential future capacity of 12 GWh. The factory is set to enter production in 2022 and will focus on manufacturing battery modules and systems for long-term, high-volume supply agreements for complete battery system solutions across grid and industrial markets.

2. Northvolt is investing $200 million in Europe's largest energy storage systems factory in Poland. The factory, located in Gdańsk, will have an annual output of 5GWh of modules and packs in its first phase, with a total capacity of 12GWh in the second phase. The company aims to become a global leader in the development and delivery of premium, sustainable battery solutions for the European market.

3. Northvolt is planning to build a gigafactory in Germany, able to supply around 1 million electric vehicles with battery cells every year. The company will invest several billion euros in this project, with subsidies provided by the German government and the state of Schleswig-Holstein, subject to approval by the European Commission. The investment will create 3,000 direct jobs in Heide, northern Germany, and additional jobs in the surrounding industry and service sector. This project is part of Europe's efforts to develop a home-grown battery industry.

It is evident that Northvolt is actively involved in expanding its manufacturing capacity and establishing itself as a prominent player in the European battery industry.
