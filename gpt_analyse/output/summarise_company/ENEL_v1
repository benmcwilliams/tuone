Enel has been involved in the TANGO (iTaliAN pv Giga factOry) project, an expansion of 3SUN, their solar panel factory located in Catania, Sicily. The project will increase the factory's production capacity from 200 MW/year to 3 GW by July 2024. The investment for this expansion amounts to around 600 million euros, which includes 118 million euros contributed by the European Union's Innovation Fund. The expansion is expected to create around 1,000 jobs and aims to reduce the continent's energy dependence by promoting high-efficiency solar technology in Europe. The factory is focused on the development of high-performance bifacial photovoltaic modules and is designed to follow sustainable and circular best practices.

The project has been progressing in stages, with the first 400 MW of the 3 GW production capacity expected to be operational by September 2023, and full operational capacity by July 2024. The factory's output has the potential to avoid the equivalent of nearly 25 million tons of CO2 in the first ten years of operation and to replace nearly 1.2 billion cubic meters of gas per year with domestically-produced renewable energy.

The factory's project financing agreement was signed with UniCredit and SACE for a maximum amount of 560 million euros. The investment is partially counter-guaranteed by SACE through the Green Guarantee, aimed at pursuing the environmental objective of climate change mitigation as part of Italy's Green New Deal.

This project demonstrates the feasibility and scalability of a sustainable industrial model, aligning with the EU's goal of achieving 40 percent energy consumption from renewable sources by 2030. The expansion of this factory represents a strategic move for Italy and Europe in balancing energy security, independence, and environmental sustainability.

The articles cover Enel's progress in advancing the expansion of the 3SUN solar panel factory, providing details about the investment, project financing, production capacity, technology, expected job creation, and sustainability practices.

Overall, Enel's focus on the TANGO project aims to significantly contribute to Europe's renewable energy targets while bolstering the continent's energy independence and promoting sustainability.
