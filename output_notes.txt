- Based on the provided data, here are the key points related to the Northvolt battery production project in Europe:
- - Northvolt is increasing production capacity by 50% at its first gigafactory in Northern Sweden, thanks to an additional $2.75bn equity fund raising.
- - The new investment will enable Northvolt to build a factory increasing capacity from 40 to 60 GWh a year, producing enough batteries for 1 million electric vehicles annually.
- - Northvolt aims to produce 25% of Europe’s batteries by 2030 and has already signed a $14bn battery order with Volkswagen for the next 10 years.
- - Northvolt Ett, under construction since Summer 2018, will be ready to start production later this year, with production expected to ramp up gradually over the next 3 - 5 years.
- - The gigafactory in Skellefteå, Sweden, will be the only large-scale facility in Europe capable of recycling lithium, cobalt, nickel, manganese, and other metals.
- - Northvolt has expanded to 2000 employees from over 70 different nationalities in Sweden, Germany, and Poland and expects to build two further gigafactories in Europe by the end of the decade.
- - The latest fund raising round takes the total raised by Northvolt to over $6.5bn, with investments from Swedish pension funds, OMERS Capital Markets, Goldman Sachs Asset Management, Volkswagen Group, and other institutional and private investors.

- Based on the provided data, here are the key points extracted from the articles related to the battery production project in Europe:
- - The project aims to address climate change by introducing new batteries with a much lower carbon footprint than existing ones.
- - Replacing internal combustion engine vehicles with electric ones alone would not sufficiently lower transport sector emissions to meet 2050 goals, as almost half of the emissions associated with electric vehicle manufacture come from battery production.
- - Private sector investors initially hesitated to lend to the new company due to a lack of firm customer orders.
- - The European Investment Bank provided a series of loans backed by the EU’s InnovFin innovation-support facility and the Investment Plan for Europe to finance the company’s demo plant.
- - Subsequently, customers began to place orders, and private sector banks and long-term investors showed interest in the project.
