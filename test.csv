1,Northvolt raises $1.2bn and Northvolt Dwa produces first ESS,2023-08-22 07:25:54+00:00,"As Northvolt assembles its first battery systems at Northvolt Dwa in Poland, the company today announced the raising of $1.2 billion to finance plans for its further European and North American expansion.

The funding is an extension of the $1.1 billion convertible note signed in July 2022, and has attracted investment from funds labeled dark green in accordance with Article 9 of the EU's Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR). Leading the extension are the Investment Management Corporation of Ontario (IMCO), BlackRock and Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPP Investments), as well as long-term financial partner OMERS, making its third major investment in the company.

In parallel, Northvolt Dwa has assembled its first energy storage system (ESS) products in GdaÅsk, Poland as part of its commissioning process. Producing battery systems at a small-scale facility located in GdaÅsk since 2019, Northvolt has built a new 25,000 square meter plant that assembles cells into battery systems for customers in energy storage and industrial markets, with support from the European Innovation Fund. As final validation of production lines concludes, customer deliveries are expected to commence later in the year.

Peter Carlsson, Co-Founder and CEO of Northvolt, commented: âIâm proud to see our continued effort being recognized by investors, as we are receiving significant interest from capital markets to support our mission. The commitment to global decarbonization is strong, and these milestones reinforces our position to meet the massive demand for sustainable battery solutions both in Europe and North America.â

The $2.3 billion convertible round raised to date includes Goldman Sachs Asset Management, AP funds 1-4 (via the co-owned company 4 to 1 Investments), Folksam Group, ATP, Volkswagen Group, AMF, Ava Investors, IMAS Foundation, Baillie Gifford, Swedbank Robur, PCS Holding, Olympia Group, TM Capital, Compagnia di San Paolo through Fondaco Growth, East Innovate, ADQ, GIC, Chow Tai Fook Enterprises (CTFE) and J. Safra Sarasin. With this capital raise, Northvolt has now secured over $9 billion in equity and debt to deliver on over $55 billion in orders from key customers, including BMW, Fluence, Scania, Volvo Cars and Volkswagen Group.

Alexander Hartman, CFO of Northvolt, commented: âWe have found a committed group of investors that understands both the urgent need and massive financial potential in enabling the swift electrification of society. However, there is a long road ahead if Europe and North America are to reach their full potential as leaders of the energy transition. To create a pathway for global warming below 1.5Â°C, both the private and public sector need to mobilize resources at an unprecedented scale.â

Northvolt battery cells are currently designed and developed at Northvolt Labs in VÃ¤sterÃ¥s, Sweden, and Northvolt Cuberg in San Leandro, California, US. Battery cell manufacturing is ramping up at Northvolt Ett gigafactory, in SkellefteÃ¥, Sweden, which will be joined by an adjacent giga-scale recycling plant, Revolt Ett, due to start operations later this year. Additional projects are under development in Sweden, Germany and Portugal.

3,Northvolt's battery factory to be built in Skellefteå,2021-11-18 00:00:00,"Today's announcement means that Northvolt intends to locate what could be Europe's largest lithium-ion battery production plant in Skellefteå. The factory is expected to provide upwards of 2000-2500 jobs and will mean local and regional development in several areas.

- Skellefteå has shown that we have the necessary conditions for an establishment of this kind. We can offer 100 percent renewable energy production, an attractive site, a well-functioning port, rail, proximity to communications and also a high quality of life with the opportunity to quickly increase the construction of housing and schools that will be needed, says Kristina Sundin Jonsson, Mayor of Skellefteå.

Hans Kreisel, CEO of Skellefteå Kraft, wants to remind everyone of the continuation and give all involved a commendation:

- This process has been a team effort from day one. Now we are taking on the intensive work that continues and are prepared to meet every step of the schedule.

Northvolt's ambition is to put the shovel in the ground in the second half of 2018 and have the first quarter of the plant completed and in production by 2020. When fully built in 2023, the factory will produce a total of 32 GWh of battery capacity per year.

- Skellefteå meets all the basic conditions for the establishment of the plant in an outstanding way. We also see a great advantage in being able to use Skellefteå's renewable energy supply,"" says Peter Carlsson, founder and CEO, Northvolt.

4,Northvolt To Step Up Battery Cell Output With $2.75 Billion Equity Round,2021-06-10 00:00:00,"This article is more than 2 years old.

Midsummer sun over Northvolt Ett Northvolt

Electric battery cell producer Northvolt is to increase production capacity by 50% at its first gigafactory in Northern Sweden, thanks to an additional $2.75bn equity fund raising agreed yesterday.

The new investment will enable Northvolt to build a factory which will take capacity up from 40 to 60 GWh a year. Northvolt will be able to produce enough batteries for 1 million electric vehicles a year, rather than 700,000 - 800,000 previously expected.

The size of the factory will stay the same, confirms Northvolt VP Jesper Wigardt.

Northvolt’s aim is to produce 25% of Europe’s batteries by 2030, but already demand from key customers is greater than expected. Earlier this year, it signed a $14 bn battery order with Volkswagen (VW) for the next 10 years, establishing it as the lead battery cell provider for the German automaker. By 2023, Northvolt batteries are likely to be in VW’s new premium EVs.

The company has realised that its gigafactories will be bigger than originally envisaged, and so it won’t need to build as many. Northvolt has decided not to build a planned joint gigabyte factory - Northvolt Zwei – in Germany with VW, instead concentrating all its production for VW at Northvolt Ett.

It won’t be all VW at Northvolt Ett – Northvolt also has contracts worth more than $13bn from BMW, Fluence and Scania.

Northvolt Ett, under construction since Summer 2018, will be ready to start production later this year. Production is expected to ramp up gradually over the next 3 - 5 years.

Located in Skellefteå, Northvolt Ett will be the only large-scale facility in Europe capable of recycling lithium as well as cobalt, nickel, manganese, and other metals.





The first gigafactory will be in production by the end of the year Northvolt

“Northvolt has almost finished two of the factory’s five production lines,” says journalist Anders Steinvall, author of The Battery Factory, Skellefteå and the journey to the land of the future. “This expansion in capacity at gigafactory means that it will probably need more than the 3,000 employees originally envisaged. Yesterday’s announcement underlines what a huge story this is locally, in an often-forgotten part of Sweden and Northern Europe.”

His forthcoming book will tell the story of how Northvolt came to choose Skellefteå as the location for its first gigafactory over some 20 other locations in the Nordics, thanks to a serendipitous combination of affordable local renewable energy, access to land and raw materials, and the city’s efforts to woo Northvolt.

A River Runs Through It

Founded by former Tesla operations executive Peter Carlsson in 2017, Northvolt wants to be the greenest battery maker in the world. It only uses green energy in production. It’s a hefty commitment, not least because of the huge amount of energy it requires to make just one battery.

So the location of Northvolt Ett has been critical. All its energy is provided by hydro-electric power from local energy provider Skellefteå Kraft, its source the Skellefteå river running down from the mountains. Skellefteå Kraft has been an investor in Northvolt since 2018.

Skelleftea Kraft had anticipated Northvolt would use two terawatt hours a year – equivalent to 1-2% of total consumption in Sweden in a year - but the figure now is likely to be higher.

In just over four years, Northvolt has expanded to 2000 employees from over 70 different nationalities in Sweden, Germany and Poland. The company expects to build two further gigafactories in Europe by the end of the decade.

Blue Chip Investors

Northvolt’s latest fund raising round takes the total raised by the Swedish startup to over $6.5 bn. Led by four Swedish pension funds, OMERS Capital Markets, Goldman Sachs Asset Management and Volkswagen Group, institutional investors include AMF, Baillie Gifford and EIT Inno Energy.

Private shareholders include some of Sweden’s leading investors, such as Spotify founder Daniel Ek, Christina Stenbeck, and Norrsken VC, created by Niklas Adalberth, co-founder of Klarna.

Speaking in Stockholm, Carlsson said, “We have a solid base of world-class investors and customers on-board who share Northvolt’s mission to build the world’s greenest battery to enable Europe’s transition to renewable energy.”",https://www.forbes.com/sites/heatherfarmbrough/2021/06/10/northvolt-to-step-up-battery-cell-output-with-275-billion-equity-round/
5,From start-up to scale-up: Europe’s first homegrown gigafactory,,"A challenge as vast and complex as climate change requires big, bold and brilliant ideas. But such ideas, by their very nature, often involve risks that few private investors have the vision, confidence or capacity to underwrite, especially when they come from start-ups.

The project is important because simply replacing all internal combustion engine vehicles with electric ones would not lower transport sector emissions enough to meet our 2050 goals—the emissions associated with battery production typically account for almost half the emissions of electric vehicle manufacture. These new batteries have a much lower carbon footprint than existing batteries. They are a perfect example of the kind of big, bold and brilliant idea that the world and European industry need.

But private sector investors balked at the idea of lending to a new company, rich in vision but poor in firm customer orders.

The European Investment Bank stepped in with a series of loans backed by the EU’s InnovFin innovation-support facility and the Investment Plan for Europe. We alone financed the company’s demo plant. Soon after, customers began to place orders and then private sector banks and long-term investors came flocking.

6,Battery venture could transform sub-Arctic Sweden,2019-08-29 10:30:10+00:00,"SKELLEFTEÅ, Sweden — This former booming gold town, which has seen its richest mine close and its population dwindle, is now hoping a huge car battery factory will secure its prosperity.

But there are risks. Competition among battery producers in Europe is intensifying and there are concerns over a potential shortage of qualified labor in Skellefteå.

“It felt fantastic when we heard the factory would be built here,” said Kristina Sundin Jonsson, head of administration for the municipality. “But we also understood that there was a lot of hard work still to do.”

Northvolt, a three-year-old company founded by two former Tesla executives, is building Europe’s largest battery plant in a massive clearing in the woods a couple of kilometers from the town center. At the factory construction site, 40,000 trees have been cut down and stacked along the dusty access road. Within secure fences, dozens of earth movers prepare the ground for what will be a building of between 400,000 square meters and 500,000 square meters.

The Northvolt investment comes at a pivotal moment for the battery industry as it seeks to meet demand from a transport sector switching from fossil fuels to electric power. Volkswagen alone estimates that it will need 150 gigawatt hours of batteries by 2025 — about five times more than the anticipated production capacity of the Northvolt factory.

Beyond the new jobs, the arrival of Northvolt will have a huge impact on infrastructure in Skellefteå.

Annual electric car sales are expected to rise from 2 million in 2018 to 10 million in 2025 and 56 million by 2040, according to an estimate by the research company Bloomberg NEF.

Key to the transition will be battery technology, the supply of which is currently dominated by companies from China, Japan and South Korea.

Location, location, location

With its Swedish factory, Northvolt is aiming to meet demand from European carmakers for batteries produced near the rest of their manufacturing operations. The Skellefteå factory will produce 8 GWh of batteries annually by 2020, rising to 32 GWh by 2023.

Paolo Cerruti, Northvolt’s chief operating officer, who founded the company with CEO Peter Carlsson in 2016, said that for European carmakers, shipping batteries from Asia is seen as higher risk because any loss or damage en route would be both expensive and have a knock-on effect on the rest of their production.

“The transportation industry is pushing for localization,” he told POLITICO. “If you are a car company, you want your production as close as possible.”

European officials have also been pushing to create battery-producing champions — worried that the EU's crucial car industry will lose its technical edge to Asian rivals. The European Investment Bank recently committed €350 million in loans to Northvolt.

“The development of a competitive and green battery value chain within Europe can not only cut greenhouse gas emissions by decarbonizing power generation and transport, but can also help protect millions of well-paid jobs in European industries in the face of increasing global competition,” EIB Vice President Andrew McDowell said after the loan was approved in May.

Volkswagen has agreed to invest €900 million in Northvolt, securing a 20 percent stake and a seat on the board, in a deal to support both Northvolt's Swedish factory and a new venture between the two companies to develop batteries at a factory in northern Germany.

That underlines that Skellefteå isn’t the only player in this game.

Beyond the new jobs, the arrival of Northvolt will have a huge impact on infrastructure in Skellefteå.

Central Europe, with its lower costs, is turning into a hub of battery manufacturing thanks to Asian investments. France and Germany are also seeking ways to encourage battery factories in their home countries. Tesla could be interested in setting up production facilities in Germany, reports suggest — and that's a lot closer to car plants than Skellefteå, lying about 800 kilometers north of Stockholm.

But officials in Skellefteå are keen to point out the advantages to Northvolt of locating there.

The area has access to abundant clean energy, cheap building land, and nearby mines in northern Sweden and Finland that can supply some of the metals needed in battery production such as nickel and cobalt. The town owns Skellefteå Kraft, an energy company that can supply enough hydroelectric power to meet all of Northvolt’s needs.

“We have all these qualities that we knew would attract new industry,” Sundin Jonsson said. “And we were very proactive and offered solutions.”

Expansion limits

However, there are concerns about how the town will be able to supply the roughly 2,500 workers the factory will need.

With a population of only 32,000 and no university, Skellefteå is short of the large numbers of engineers and technicians Northvolt will need. To address this, hiring fairs are already underway across Sweden.

Cerruti said he expects around half the factory’s staff to be recruited locally and half from elsewhere.

Beyond the new jobs, the arrival of Northvolt will have a huge impact on infrastructure in Skellefteå. New roads and housing have to be built and rail links and the coastal harbor will be upgraded.

While the mood in the town is largely upbeat about Northvolt, locals are also well aware that things don’t always go as planned with large industrial projects.

In the town of Pajala in the far north of Sweden, a large iron ore mine, which was supposed to be the future of the area, collapsed after prices on commodity markets plunged. Across the Gulf of Bothnia in Finland, the effect of the decline of Nokia’s phonemaking operations on the town of Salo is well-documented.

Åke Andersson, an 81-year-old retired music teacher, cycled up from his home in a nearby suburb to check on progress at the building site. He said it is hard to take in the scale of the project or truly understand the prospects for battery production.

“I hope someone doesn’t invent some other kind of fuel in the meantime,” he said.
