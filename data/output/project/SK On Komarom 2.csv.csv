SK Innovation subsidized for Hungarian battery plant,2021-07-20 00:00:00,"The South Korean battery cell manufacturer SK Innovation received a subsidy of 90 million euros from the Hungarian government for its second plant in the country. The prerequisite was that the EU Commission give the green light for the state aid, which has now happened.

SK Innovation says it is investing about 945 billion won in the construction of its second plant in Komárom – the equivalent of just under 700 million euros. SKI is now receiving the 90 million euro subsidy from the Hungarian state “regarding the anticipated positive effects on the local economy and employment from the operation of the second EV plant in Hungary”, as the battery manufacturer announced.

By way of background, the Commission, taking into account EU state aid rules and in particular Article 107(3c) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, may authorise member states to support the development of certain economic sectors “under certain conditions”. These economic sectors must be of common European interest.

In the case of SKI, the European Commission approved the Hungarian government’s subsidy plan after a ten-month review. “This is an exceptional case for the European Commission, which is known to be very strict about giving approvals, to grant such huge amount of subsidy to a Korean company in such a short period,” SK Innovation writes.

In June, the group division had already received a loan of 500 million US dollars from the Export-Import Bank of Korea for the same plant. The loan is a green loan fund, which SKI says it obtained on “favourable financial terms”. SK Innovation’s second battery cell plant will be built in the same way as the first plant in Komárom and is to have an annual capacity of 10 GWh. The plan is for construction to be completed this year and commercial production to begin in 2022. Earlier this year, SK Innovation also decided to build a third battery cell factory in Hungary, specifically in Iváncsa, 50 kilometres southwest of Budapest.

SKI currently only develops and produces pouch cells. As SK Innovation’s battery boss Jee Dong-seob recently confirmed at South Korea’s largest battery trade fair, Inter Battery, the company is also looking into the development and production of new types of battery cells, including cylindrical and prismatic cells. In this way, the South Korean company wants to expand their customer base. As is well known, Tesla relies on round cells in various formats, but the vehicles from the Giga Shanghai also use other cell types in some cases. While the pouch cell initially seemed to prevail among European carmakers, the VW Group’s new unit cell will be a prismatic cell.

At the beginning of July, SK Innovation announced its intention to expand its production capacities to a total of over 500 GWh by 2030 and to consider an IPO of the battery division. The expansion of the division is driven, among other things, by the high order backlog: according to SKI, there are orders for more than one TWh – i.e. 1,000 GWh. At the same time, the company currently has a production capacity of only 40 GWh per year.

According to SKI, the orders are worth 130 trillion won, which is equivalent to about 97 billion euros. These batteries are expected to be able to power about 14 million electric cars. “SK Innovation aims to become a global leader in EV battery market through aggressive investment,” Jee Dong-seob said, according to the latest announcement. “We will make consistent efforts to contribute to the development of local communities and EV market.”

SK Innovation To Build Third EV Battery Plant In Hungary,,"SK Innovation intends to build a third lithium-ion battery cell plant in Hungary. The company already operates a 7.5 GWh factory in Komarom and is building the second 10 GWh factory at the site.

The new, third factory willt be located in Ivancsa and produce up to 30 GWh of cells annually. The construction should start in the third quarter of this year, while the start of production is scheduled for early 2024. The plant should be fully completed by 2028. At this point, we are not sure what will be the final manufacturing capacity.

According to media reports, the initial investment in the new site will be 1.3 trillion won ($1.16 billion), but the total cost, by 2028, is expected at 2.6 trillion won ($2.3 billion).

SK Innovation supplies batteries to multiple global manufacturers, including Volkswagen, Ford and Hyundai. Hungary is in a great position to become a battery hub because multiple car factories are in a relatively close proximity.

However, probably the biggest factor in selecting the country for the investment is something else - subsidies. Bloomberg reports:

""Hungary plans to provide the biggest investment subsidy in its history, Szijjarto said, adding that the government would make the size of the aid public once the agreement was signed with SK Innovation and the process of notification with the EU has been completed.""

Hungary simply is willing to offer a high incentive to attract a plant that will have 2,500 direct jobs.

Currently, SK Innovation's total battery manufacturing capacity (globally) stands at about 40 GWh annually, but it's expected to increase several times over just a few years.

SK Innovation to build second battery plant in Hungary,,"South Korea’s SK Innovation will invest a total of some HUF 239 billion (approx. EUR 750 million) to build its second battery plant in Komárom (NW Hungary), creating 1,000 new jobs, Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade Péter Szijjártó announced at a press conference in Budapest on Wednesday.

Szijjártó told the press that construction of the facility, which will manufacture batteries for electric vehicles, will begin in March, with production expected to begin in late 2021 or early 2022, according to official Hungarian government website kormany.hu.

SK Innovation earlier purchased a 430,000 square-meter plot of land in Komárom for the construction of the 112,000 sqm building, he added.

The announcement follows less than a year after the company began construction of a first, HUF 97.5 billion plant to make lithium batteries for electric vehicles in Komárom, for which the government awarded a non-repayable grant of HUF 8.17 bln at the time.

“The government will be contributing to the project with non-returnable funding, but negotiations with the investors are still underway with relation to the level of that funding,” the minister stated of the new investment, adding that the high added value-generating production and deployment of state-of-the-art technologies in Hungary justified the state assistance.

SK Innovation picked Hungary for the investment amid fierce regional competition, drawn by the quality of the local labor force, Szijjártó asserted. He noted that three of the big five Asian battery makers - SK Innovation, Samsung and GS Yuasa - now have manufacturing capacity in Hungary.

Szijjártó said the region is capable of meeting the workforce requirements of the new battery plant in Komárom, as the city and surrounding settlements have a high level of skilled labor and higher education is following the demands of the labor market.",https://bbj.hu/business/industry/pharma/sk-innovation-to-build-second-battery-plant-in-hungary

SK Innovation Battery Business Improves: Q2 2021 Results,,"SK Innovation, the South Korean conglomerate mostly focused on its Refining, Petrochem and Lubricants divisions, reports positive financial results for the second quarter of 2021. The company increased sales and noted profits.

The lithium-ion EV battery business (one of the largest globally) expands quickly and according to the official announcement will be split off from SK Innovation in October 2021. Previously, LG Chem similarly split off its battery business into a wholly-owned subsidiary LG Energy Solution (poised for an IPO).

""SK Innovation held the board of directors (BOD) meeting led by Chairman Kim Jong-hoon on the 3rd and decided to spin off its battery and E&P businesses, after announcing that these two businesses have been fully recognized for their growth potential and competitiveness. The spin-off decision was based on the necessity to enhance SK innovation’s corporate value. Following this, the extraordinary general meeting will take place for approval of the matter on September 16th, and the new tentatively named companies “SK Battery Co., Ltd.” and “SK E&P Co., Ltd.” will officially come to existence starting October 1st.""

SK Innovation’s corporate structure (Before and After the upcoming spin-off):

In the second quarter of 2021, the company as a whole was profitable:

sales: 11,120 billion KRW ($9.65 billion) up 56% year-over-year

11,120 billion KRW ($9.65 billion) up 56% year-over-year operating profits: 506 billion KRW ($440 million)

506 billion KRW ($440 million) pre-tax income: 648 billion KRW ($560 million)

Business performance - ""Other""

The battery business, included in the category named ""Other,"" remains only a small part of the entire company, but it's expanding. A good sign also is that the losses decreased.

sales: 670 billion KRW ($580 million)

670 billion KRW ($580 million) operating profits: -162 billion KRW (-$140 million)

-162 billion KRW (-$140 million) pre-tax income: -6.5 billion KRW ($5.6 million)

Battery business

In the second quarter of 2021, SK Innovation increased battery sales by about 86% year-over-year. It remains unprofitable, but the operating margin of negative 16% is much better than before.

The company explains that it's because of the volume deliveries of batteries for the Hyundai Ioniq 5 and the early stabilization of new plants.

""Battery business recorded KRW 630.2 billion of revenue, an increase of about 86% compared to the same period of 2020 (KRW 338.2 billion) thanks to the expansion of new sales volume. This record follows KRW 523.6 billion in Q1, which means for two consecutive quarters, battery business has exceeded the KRW 500 billion sales record. Also, after surpassing KRW 144.3 billion won the fourth quarter of 2018, it broke a new quarterly ales record with more than KRW 600 billion this quarter.""

sales: 630 billion KRW ($550 million); up about 86% year-over-year

630 billion KRW ($550 million); up about 86% year-over-year operating profits: -101 billion KRW (-$88 million)

-101 billion KRW (-$88 million) operating margin: -16%

Profits are expected next year:

""Accordingly, the annual operating profit in 2022 for SK Innovation’s battery business is expected to be a surplus. Then with the quick recovery of the operating profit margin starting from 2023, the company expects to keep high single-digit profit from 2025.""

SK Innovation is investing heavily in the new battery plants - in Europe, China, and the U.S. The company intends to increase its annual battery cell output from about 40 GWh this year, to over 500 GWh by 2030:

2021: about 40 GWh

2023: 85 GWh

2025: 200 GWh (compared to 125 GWh previously, and 190 GWh, after the announcement of BlueOvalSK joint venture with Ford)

2030: over 500 GWh

As we can see on the map, the main expansion will be in the U.S. (22 GWh under construction and 60 GWh announced), which shows how painful the ban would've been without the settlement with LG Chem's LG Energy Solution.
