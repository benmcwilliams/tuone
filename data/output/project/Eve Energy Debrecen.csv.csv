Groundbreaking ceremony for Eve Energy’s Hungarian battery factory,2023-11-30 00:00:00,"This was announced by company boss Liu Jincheng at an event in China, according to Gasgoo Autonews, without giving further details. The Eve Energy factory in Debrecen, Hungary, which was announced in May, will supply BMW with large cylindrical cells for New Class electric cars.

According to information from May, Eve Energy will invest around one billion euros in the factory. The Hungarian government is supporting the construction with 14 billion forints, the equivalent of around 38 million euros. The battery factory is being built on a 45-hectare site in the so-called Northwest Economic Belt, which is reserved for BMW suppliers.

BMW itself laid the foundation stone for its electric car plant in Debrecen in mid-2022, and in late summer and fall 2022, appointed a total of three suppliers to manufacture the new cylindrical-format battery cells in the ‘New Class’ electric models. In addition to Eve Energy, these are CATL and AESC. Together, they will cover the regions of North America, Europe and China with the construction of six factories.

The cylindrical cells from BMW are known to have a uniform diameter of 46 millimetres and two different heights (format: 46XX). According to BMW, the module level is no longer required for installation: the cylindrical cells are “flexibly and space-savingly integrated into the installation space”. The storage system takes on a supporting role in the body structure. In technical jargon, this battery concept is called “pack-to-open-body”.

In an interview published by the BMW press department, the car manufacturer’s battery experts explained the background to the switch from prismatic battery cells to cylindrical cells. “At the beginning of the process, we really started with a blank sheet of paper and were open to all cell formats and sizes. But given the ambitious targets in terms of performance and safety, we soon came to the conclusion that the round cell was the best format for our next generation,” said Peter Lamp, a long-time BMW battery developer. “It also fits best with our integration approach for the New Class: ‘cell-to-pack’ and ‘pack-to-open-body’.”

Eve Energy to build battery factory in Hungary,2023-05-10 00:00:00,"The Chinese battery cell manufacturer Eve Energy will build its first European factory in Debrecen, Hungary, to supply BMW with large round cells for new-class electric cars. This had been hinted at before – and is now officially confirmed.

According to Hungarian media reports based on official statements by Hungary’s Foreign Minister Péter Szijjártó and on an announcement by Eve Energy, the factory in Debrecen will have an annual capacity of 28 gigawatt-hours and go into operation in 2026. According to Szijjártó, Eve Energy will invest around 400 billion forints (just over 1 billion euros) in the factory and create over 1,000 new jobs. The Hungarian government is supporting the construction with 14 billion forints, the equivalent of about 38 million euros.

The cell plant is to be built on 45 hectares in the so-called Northwest Economic Belt, which is reserved for BMW suppliers. The German carmaker itself laid the foundation stone for its electric car plant in Debrecen in mid-2022 and in late summer and autumn 2022 appointed a total of three suppliers to produce the new round-format battery cells in the “New Class” electric models. In addition to Eve Energy, these are CATL and Envision AESC. Together they are to cover the regions of North America, Europe and China with the construction of six factories.

It is now clear that Eve Energy is contributing a plant in Europe. This had already been hinted at: According to reports from late March 2022, Eve Energy had already signed a non-binding letter of intent with the Debrecen Municipality at the time to acquire 45 hectares in an industrial area and build a cylindrical cell production plant there. Most recently, Eve Energy has also made headlines with a strong capacity expansion in China. However, it has not been confirmed whether the announced new buildings will include an exclusive plant for BMW.

What is clear, however, is that Envision AESC will cover the North American cell deliveries for BMW. An Envision AESC factory announced in October for South Carolina with up to 30 GWh will be the company’s first of two planned production facilities in the region dedicated to BMW supply. CATL is expected to complement Eve Energy in its supply activities in Europe and China. Details are not yet available. But: CATL is also setting up a 100 GWh factory in Debrecen, with Mercedes as a major customer.

BMW’s round cells will have a uniform diameter of 46 millimetres and two different heights (format: 46XX). According to BMW, the module level is omitted during installation: the round cells are “integrated flexibly and space-savingly in the installation space”. The storage system takes on a supporting role in the body structure. In technical jargon, this battery concept is called “pack-to-open-body”.

It has been known for some time that the vehicles of the New Class will use an 800-volt system with up to 350 kW charging power in addition to this battery concept. In this way, a significantly increased charging performance can be achieved with direct current charging at a current strength of up to 500 amperes, as BMW recently specified. “The time required for charging from ten to 80 per cent is reduced by up to 30 per cent.”

EVE Energy to build its 1st European plant in Hungary,2023-05-10 00:00:00,"China's EVE Energy Co. Ltd. plans to build a plant for the production of electric vehicle batteries in Debrecen, eastern Hungary, the country's Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade Peter Szijjarto said on Tuesday.

The battery cell manufacturer, the world's ninth largest, will invest around 400 billion Hungarian forints (1.18 billion U.S. dollars) in the project and will create over 1,000 new jobs.

Hungary's government will support the project with 14 billion forints. EVE Energy aims to fulfill the demand for new-generation cylindrical battery cells by German carmaker BMW's plant in Hungary.

According to Szijjarto, the government of Hungary aims to make the country a global leader in environmental protection. He noted that 95 percent of the water needs of the plant will be provided from treated wastewater and surface water, and the company will also recycle part of the technological wastewater on site.

He said that the transition to electric road transport is key to achieving this goal and to meeting the European Union's green transition requirements.

""Without electric cars, the European Green Deal cannot be a success, and there are no electric cars without electric batteries,"" he said.

Debrecen has also been chosen as home to a giant 7.34-billion-euro (8 billion U.S. dollars) battery factory to be built by China's Contemporary Amperex Technology Co., Limited(CATL). (1 Hungarian forint = 0.0030 U.S. dollar)",http://www.china.org.cn/business/2023-05/10/content_85277771.htm
EVE Formally Invests in Cylindrical Battery Project in Hungary and Acquires Land for New Project in Malaysia,,"Chinese suppliers for Li-ion batteries are actively internationalize their operations and form strategic partnerships with foreign companies involved in the upstream and downstream sections of the industry chain. On June 8, EVE announced two new developments in its ongoing overseas expansion.

First, the board of EVE issued a notice approving a proposal on building a plant in Hungary for manufacturing cylindrical batteries used in electric passenger vehicles. EVE Power Hungary Kft., a wholly-owned subsidiary, will invest no more than RMB 9.97 billion in setting up the plant. The EVE Power Hungary will be spending its own capital as well as raise the money from other sources for funding this project. Located in Debrecen, the plant would provide a large amount of new production capacity for a new-type of large-sized cylindrical Li-ion battery cells.

EVE said the plant in Debrecen will contribute to its overseas expansion and internationalization of its business operations. Furthermore, the plant will help the company to scale up and optimize production so that it can capture more orders from clients working in the fast-growing field of NEVs. All in all, this investment will enhance the company’s position in the market for NEV power batteries.

Placing a plant in Hungary will allow EVE to promptly respond to the demand from the local vehicle manufacturing plants. Besides this, the plant will radiate EVE’s influence across the whole Europe, providing opportunities for EVE to secure contracts from the major vehicle manufacturers based in the region.

Regarding the other development, EVE also disclosed that progress has been made in setting up a battery production plant in Malaysia. A sub-subsidiary EVE Energy Malaysia Sdn. Bhd. has signed a land purchase agreement with Pemaju Kelang Lama Sdn. Bhd. and its holding subsidiary G&C Utama Sdn. Bhd. In October 2022, the board of EVE approved a proposal on investing in a project for manufacturing cylindrical batteries in Malaysia. To implement this project, EVE would spend its own capital and self-raised funds totaling no more than US$422.3 million (around RMB 3 billion).

EVE said the project in Malaysia leverages the company’s own technological advantages and the country’s advantages in resources, thereby significantly scaling up the production of cylindrical batteries. Moreover, the project will meet the demand from manufacturers for electric scooters and power tools within Malaysia and other parts of the Southeast Asia. Hence, EVE will be able to further reinforce its strong position in the fields of batteries used in electric light vehicles and power tools.

EVE is one of the few battery suppliers that possesses core technologies for both batteries used in consumer electronics and batteries used in NEVs. Furthermore, it is the first Chinese battery supplier that has developed offerings related to 46-series cylindrical batteries and other large-sized ternary batteries. In China, EVE now plans to add new production capacity in Jingmen (Hubei Province), Chengdu (Sichuan Province), and Shenyang (Liaoning Province). Additionally, it has secured confirmation from tier-1 carmakers for the adoption of its batteries. These carmakers include Dayun Automobile and BMW.

Regarding financial performance, EVE’s revenue for 1Q23 came to RMB 11.186 billion, up 66.11% YoY. The company maintains an optimal balance among its three main businesses: consumer batteries, NEV batteries, and energy storage batteries. At the same time, it continues to capture market share and improve its position within the industry in order to drive rapid revenue growth.
