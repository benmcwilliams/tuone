Slovakia's InoBat eyes electric car battery plant in Spain,2022-10-19 00:00:00,"MADRID, Oct 19 (Reuters) - Slovakian battery manufacturer InoBat said on Wednesday it had signed a declaration of intent with the Spanish government to set up an electric vehicle battery factory in the city of Valladolid in central Spain.

The declaration is not a finalised agreement and other locations, including the United Kingdom, remain under consideration for its Western European gigafactory, the company added in a statement, explaining that it plans to make a decision on the location before the end of the year.

According to the Spanish Industry Ministry, the plant is expected to cost 3 billion euros ($2.94 billion) and would create more than 2,000 direct jobs.

InoBat, which has a plant in Slovakia and has announced another planned site in the U.S. state of Indiana, considers Valladolid an attractive location due to its wealth of talent, access to renewable energy, proximity to equipment manufacturers and strong transport links.

It would be the fourth car battery project in Spain, although its viability will depend on whether it qualifies for a portion of European COVID-19 pandemic recovery funds that Spain has earmarked for electric cars and batteries manufacturing.

Spain has a partnership agreement with Chinese green energy company Envision Group to build a battery plant for electric cars in Extremadura, developed jointly with Spanish renewable power company Acciona Energia (ANE.MC).

German carmaker Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE) and its partners plan to invest 7 billion euros in a factory in Valencia.

A group known as BASQUEVOLT also plans to build a plant in the Basque Country, where the regional government, Iberdrola (IBE.MC), CIE Automotive (CIEA.MC) and Enagas (ENAG.MC), are among the shareholders.

InoBat to build battery factory in Valladolid,2022-10-20 00:00:00,"InoBat Auto has signed a letter of intent with Spanish authorities to build a factory in Valladolid. At the same time, however, the Slovakian battery manufacturer itself relativises the significance of the document by affirming that other locations in Western Europe are still in the running.

Already in spring, InoBat had announced that it would build its third plant for electric car batteries in Western Europe and that it would decide on a location by the end of the year. The two other factories are a pilot plant with 100 MWh that has been put into operation in the meantime and a planned production facility with 10 GWh in Slovakia.

Despite the declaration of intent, InoBat apparently does not want to commit itself to Spain. The company emphasises that the signed document is not yet a firm agreement and that sites in the UK are still being considered for the factory. The signing of the letters of intent is intended to ensure that if Spain is selected, InoBat will have the necessary permits and government support to move the project forward quickly. InoBat Auto plans to make a final decision on the location of its battery factory in Western Europe later this year.

In the summer, the Slovaks had also announced that they wanted to examine battery assembly and cell production in the USA. Together with the US company Ideanomics, which specialises in e-commercial vehicles, InoBat says it is planning a three-stage project for the development and production of batteries in the US state of Indiana.

InoBat’s business model is based on quickly developing customised battery solutions for customer vehicles. This is currently being done on the basis of the company’s first generation of battery cells. This is an NCM622 pouch cell. Compared to a benchmark cell from Asia, it is said to be able to charge from five to 80 per cent 25 per cent faster, have a 20 per cent longer service life and offer 28 per cent better capacity retention at -20 degrees Celsius.

"InoBat Provides Operational Update Following Significant 2022 Progress, Battery Manufacturing Pilot Line to be Completed Q1 2023 with Current Workforce Set to Double when Operational",2022-12-22 23:12:49+00:00,"InoBat provides operational update following significant 2022 progress, battery manufacturing pilot line to be completed Q1 2023 with current workforce set to double when operational.

InoBat (“InoBat” or the “Company”), the European pioneer of premium electric battery R&D, engineering, and production, provides an operational update following the achievement of key development milestones this year and the significant progress made towards the Company’s future growth plans.

In summer 2021, InoBat began the construction of its EV battery R&D and pilot line facility on a brownfield site in Voderady, Slovakia. With a footprint of ~9,500 sqm, the site has progressed rapidly and now encompasses state-of-the-art laboratories, a dedicated R&D centre and a manufacturing pilot line, all on track to be commissioned in Q1 2023.

The facility will be the epicentre of InoBat’s agile approach to product development, providing an “all-in-one” location solution – from chemistry research and cell development to battery production and recycling capability.

This successfully showcases InoBat’s “cradle-to-cradle” circular economy approach in support of the Sustainable Development Goals of the UN (SDG 2030), which heavily influenced the decision to use an existing site to house InoBat’s first operations, reducing the need for carbon intensive construction methods.

The facility continues to progress swiftly and is on track to be up and running as planned in Q1 2023, with the production of tailor-made electric battery cells for InoBat’s customers set to begin shortly afterwards. With customer orders already signed, the facility’s current employee base will more than double to 150 as the site becomes fully operational, with one-third of the employee-base remaining entirely focused on R&D and product development.

The facility will benefit significantly from Slovakia’s wealth of engineering talent and the intellectual capability developed at Voderady will sustain all of InoBat’s future sites.

This is only the first stage of development, however, as InoBat’s modular approach will enable the scale up of the plant in stages to ensure its expansion is in line with offtake demand, allowing the initial ~45MWh per annum capability to grow to gigafactory scale in a considered manner.

As well as ensuring future capacity can be added smoothly without interrupting operations, this approach will also support production flexibility and the future-proofing of InoBat’s operations as processes evolve.

InoBat’s significant progress builds on the foundations that were carefully laid at its creation in 2019, with much of the past three years focused on investing in its own proprietary R&D, taking the view that European companies must develop their own ideas if they are to compete with established international manufacturers in Asia.

For InoBat, it has been key to take a customer-focused approach and concentrate on creating the right product for customer needs before building very large, giga scale manufacturing facilities. Collaboration is key for success and, importantly, InoBat has already signed customer agreements with players in the commercial vehicle industry and the electric vertical take-off and landing aircraft sector, with the first cells already shipped and $2 million of initial revenues realised.

In addition, InoBat benefits from an extensive further pipeline and is currently in discussions with 30+ parties.

Marian Bocek, CEO of InoBat Auto, commented:

I am incredibly pleased with the progress that has been made since we began developing our Voderady site just over a year ago.

“What was once a disused building is now an advanced research, development, and production facility with a top calibre R&D and operations team, all sitting under one roof.”

“At the heart of our success is InoBat’s truly differentiated approach to produce tailor-made EV battery solutions, understanding that no two customers’ needs are alike. Our bespoke batteries provide customers with longer range, longer lifecycle, higher energy density and faster charging time – and most importantly, we develop our products first before scaling up our manufacturing capability.”

“With tailor-made products for key customers under our belt, supported by an excellent R&D and operational team, we have all we need to succeed and will continue to drive forward on our journey to become a leading player in green mobility.”

The significant progress of InoBat’s Voderady facility is just the first operational step towards a global ambition to drive the transition towards EV mobility whilst localising value-chains through local partnerships and alliances.

InoBat currently has a portfolio of projects under development in Europe and the US with plans that will see InoBat develop a network of sites and, eventually, gigafactories, with local partners. This important step began in June 2022, when InoBat announced plans – along with cornerstone investor, Ideanomics, and the State of Indiana – to develop a new facility in Indiana.

This was swiftly followed by the announcement of InoBat’s planned site in Serbia, with support from the Government of Serbia and IFC. InoBat will also soon be announcing the location of the company’s third gigafactory, planned for Western Europe, with declarations of intent signed with authorities in Spain although other locations, such as the UK, remain under consideration.

These three gigafactories – one in Eastern Europe (Serbia), one in Western Europe (location to be confirmed) and one in the US (Indiana) – will all be developed in a phased approach aligned with offtake demand, in 4GWh modules until they reach full-scale gigafactories.

These future facilities will be supported by the intellectual capability produced at InoBat’s existing Voderady site as well as its first UK site at the University of Warwick Science Park’s Warwick Innovation Centre.

InoBat to build battery gigafactory in western Europe,2022-04-06 00:00:00,"The Slovakian battery company InoBat Auto wants to build its third gigafactory for electric car batteries in Western Europe. A decision on the specific location is to be made this year. The company is also recruiting its board of directors.

According to the company, the planned factory will be located in the EU and the UK. The company believes that one of the reasons why the announced project is possible is the “successful validation of the performance of InoBat’s customised 622 and 811 battery cells”. This development, it says, has led to a sufficient purchase forecast “to acquire the first 4 GWh module of the 32 GWh project”.

With the announcement on the future factory, InoBat also announced that it had restructured its board, another measure to enable the announced project, InoBat said. The chairman is now Andy Palmer. InoBat had hired the former CEO of Aston Martin and COO of Nissan as “non-executive vice chairman” in 2020. Palmer now replaces Faysal Sohail, who previously held the chairman role and who will continue to be actively involved in the company’s development as chairman of the advisory board. Tara Lindstedt, Vazil Hudak and Kathryn Baker have also been appointed to the board.

“I’m delighted to announce our intention to start deployment of our gigafactories in Western Europe, which has been made possible by our innovative and hard-working team who have proven that our approach of designing electric batteries tailored to specific customer missions is a resounding success,” says Marian Bocek, co-founder and CEO of InoBat Auto. “Our new structure and Board will fast track the implementation of our ambitious platform for growth.”

InoBat Auto’s goal is to provide customers with customised battery cells for their intended use – using high-throughput screening (a method derived from pharmaceutical research) and artificial intelligence, the company aims to find the right cell chemistry for each individual application. The Slovakians have customers from the passenger car, commercial vehicle, motorsports and aerospace sectors in mind as potential customers.

The Slovakian company is planning a 100 MWh pilot production facility in Voderady and a 10 GWh factory from 2024. Some of the manufacturing equipment will be supplied by Manz. Most recently, Ideanomics, an eMobility company based in New York, had become an investor. The investment of an unspecified amount is intended to support the completion of the R&D centre and the pilot battery plant by the end of 2022. Other investors include Rio Tinto, Amara Raja and the World Bank’s private arm, the IFC.

Meanwhile, InoBatt has announced a collaboration with Gigamine, a technology-driven battery recycling company. Together, they aim to create a state-of-the-art process and supporting infrastructure for the cost-effective collection, processing and reuse of battery manufacturing materials and end-of-life batteries.

Recycling and the active reprocessing of materials to minimise waste and maximise the circular economy are key factors in the choice of location for the aforementioned planned Gigafactory, according to InoBat.

InoBat begins construction on first-of-its-kind electric vehicle battery center,2021-06-03 14:02:42+00:00,"Construction has begun on a first-of-its-kind electric vehicle (EV) battery R&D center and pilot line in Slovakia, integrating proprietary R&D activities together with battery cell-manufacturing capabilities under one roof.

Set to be operational in early 2022, the new battery center is being built by leading European electric vehicle battery developer and producer, InoBat Auto, who is developing premium batteries which can be quickly and efficiently tailored to meet the specifications of any electric vehicle.

Powered by green energy through grid electricity and solar panels, the 290,000 ft²(27,000m²) site will create up to 150 skilled jobs, and will include a technical training center, modern office space, research labs and manufacturing line. InoBat, which purchased the existing brownfield site to reduce the need for carbon intensive construction methods, will use the new battery center, to identify the optimum cell chemistries to meet the exact requirements of any vehicle maker or manufacturer faster and more efficiently than competitors.

European Commission Vice-President, Maroš Šefčovič, in charge of the European Battery Alliance, said: “I am delighted that the private sector is maintaining the momentum built up by the European Battery Alliance. This ambitious new InoBat Auto project represents another significant stepping stone towards building a competitive, innovative and sustainable battery value chain here in Europe. This will help bolster our strategic autonomy and protect millions of jobs in the face of increasing global competition – particularly important in Central Europe.”

“The European Commission will therefore continue to mobilize all industrial actors, Member States and the European Investment Bank to shift things into a higher gear – leveraging investment, establishing a fit-for-future regulatory framework, building our raw materials resilience and upskilling people to meet the fast-growing needs of the battery ecosystem – so that our automotive industry can stay out in front.”

The site, located 40km outside of Bratislava in Voderady, is situated in the center of Central Europe’s automotive hub, with more than 4.25 million vehicles produced annually in a 500 km radius from the facility. InoBat is also preparing to build a 1GWh Gigafactory in Voderady, Slovakia before scaling up to a 32GWh Gigafactory to support and serve the international market at scale.

Marian Bocek, Co-Founder and CEO of InoBat, commented: “On behalf of InoBat, our partners and our dedicated investors, we are thrilled construction is now underway and look forward to rapidly developing the newest battery technology to help accelerate the much-needed electrification of all forms of transport from our world-class hub here in Slovakia.”

“Our new home, which sits in the heart of the European vehicle and automaker ecosystem, will become a center of excellence for battery development, and we look forward to working with current and future partners to deliver the best batteries customized directly to meet exact specifications for electric vehicle in the automotive, aviation, commercial and industrial sectors.”

The landmark event comes just five weeks after InoBat signed a landmark agreement with SOR, one of the largest producers of city and intercity-buses in Central Europe, with the intention to design, develop and supply batteries for a new urban, intercity and long-distance electric bus fleet.

InoBat has also announced a strategic partnership with leader in automation, industrial software and intelligent infrastructure, Siemens, to digitalize InoBat’s entire value chain for electric vehicle battery production.
