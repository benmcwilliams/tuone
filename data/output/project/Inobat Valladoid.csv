Bratislava, 19 October 2022: InoBat Auto (“InoBat” or “the Company”), the European pioneer of premium electric vehicle battery R&D, engineering, production and recycling, today announces that it has signed protocols and declarations of intent with the Spanish authorities for the construction of a new production facility in Valladolid, Spain.

While the declaration of intent is not a finalised agreement and other locations remain under consideration, Valladolid’s wealth of talent, access to renewable energy, proximity to other OEMs and strong transport links make it a very attractive location for InoBat’s next facility.

The signing of protocols and declarations of intent with Valladolid City Council, Junta de Castilla y León, and the Ministry of Industry will ensure that, if Spain is selected, InoBat will have the necessary permits and governmental support to progress the project at pace.

This signing presents a significant opportunity for InoBat’s expansion and a key next step in the company’s plans to create a network of EV battery production plants across the globe. When the decision on InoBat’s gigafactory location in Western Europe is finalised, this facility will complement InoBat’s current plant in Voderady, Slovakia and recently announced site in Indiana, USA. All these locations, both confirmed and under consideration, are attractive due to key characteristics such as their access to renewable energy, future customers, and skilled labour.

Marian Boček, InoBat Auto Chief Executive Officer,“I am incredibly grateful to the Spanish authorities, both at regional and national level, for their support for InoBat’s next stage of growth. Valladolid is an ideal prospective location for our next facility – it is the beating heart of Spain’s automotive and engineering sectors and has extremely competitive access to suppliers, customers and, most importantly, EV talent. People will always be our most important asset and proximity to Europe’s leading engineers, chemists and technologists will be key in deciding the location of our next site. I’m incredibly pleased with how far InoBat has progressed in three short years and our next site will be a significant milestone in our development as we continue on our exciting journey towards a net zero future.”

InoBat signs declarations of intent with the Republic of Serbia for the construction of a new EV battery gigafactory,,"InoBat signs declarations of intent with the Republic of Serbia for the construction of a new EV battery gigafactory

Represents the strong intentions of both parties to develop a sustainable EV battery value chain in Serbia

The Serbian government has offered financial and material support for the construction and operation of a battery manufacturing and recycling facility, which will create new jobs and will catalyse new investments in e-mobility in the country

The development of InoBat’s project in Serbia is supported by International Finance Corporation (‘IFC’) as part of IFC’s strategic support for its member countries in Europe to mobilise private sector investments into the green transition of their economies

14 November 2022: InoBat Auto (“InoBat”), the European pioneer of high performing electric vehicle battery R&D, engineering, production and recycling, has signed protocols and declarations of intent with the Government of the Republic of Serbia for the construction of a new gigafactory in Serbia.

InoBat completed a detailed review of several European countries and has selected the Republic of Serbia, alongside other locations with suitable criteria for setting up a gigafactory and the associated value chains for the manufacturing and recycling of battery cells for electric vehicles and stationary energy storage.

This declaration of intent represents the decision and mutual support of both parties to establish a facility in Serbia and if finalised, the relevant Serbian authorities will work with InoBat to secure all of the permits and licenses required for the sustainable construction and operation of the gigafactory. The Serbian government will also provide financial and material support to ensure the successful development of the facility. InoBat has already established its Serbian subsidiary, InoBat Auto Beograd. This initiative is supported by IFC via its early-stage project development engagement with InoBat to establish a new EV battery factory in Central and Southeast Europe, signed in January of this year.

Ana Brnabic, Prime Minister of the Serbian government commented: “This is an important milestone for Serbia in positioning our country as a great contributor to sustainable and green future and among leading European players in this highly innovative and ground-breaking strategic industrial sector. The InoBat investment is more proof of our efforts to ensure that Serbia is developing in line with the newest technological and industrial trends and that our country is a top investment destination. We will continue to work resolutely on further development in order to create an even better conditions for the well-being of both our citizens and everyone who lives and does business in Serbia.”

Ary Naim, Regional Manager for Central and Southeast Europe of the International Finance Corporation added: “Serbia is well positioned to continue attracting manufacturing investment, and become a centrepiece for the E-mobility revolution in Europe, creating new jobs and opportunities in the economy of tomorrow for decades to come. An InoBat gigafactory in Serbia could serve as the anchor that will catalyse much more investment up and down regional manufacturing value chains.”

Marian Bocek, CEO of InoBat said: “The Serbian government have been exceptional partners and I am incredibly grateful for their ongoing support. The agreement reflects our shared ambition for the future of green mobility and the importance of fostering sustainable growth models. This additional step builds on InoBat’s progress over the past three years and is an exciting sign of what’s to come. Our pilot facility in Slovakia is near completion, and we have lined up the development of a new facility in the US and recently signed declarations of intent for the construction of a facility in Spain. I look forward to working alongside the Republic of Serbia as we progress towards a greener more sustainable future.”

This development represents further progress on InoBat’s plan to develop a global network of gigafactories based on its “cradle-to-cradle” circular value chain, which integrates chemistry research, cell development, battery production and material recycling in one location. InoBat is currently developing its main R&D hub in Voderady, Slovakia, which is progressing rapidly with the battery manufacturing line to be completed Q1 2023 and has recently announced that it has secured the necessary regional incentives to progress the development of its first North American facility in Indiana, which will create up to 80 full-time manufacturing jobs. In three years since inception, InoBat has already signed customer agreements with companies in the commercial vehicle and electric vertical take-off and landing aircraft sectors, with the first cells shipped and initial revenues realised, and benefits from an extensive further pipeline.

Slovakia's InoBat eyes electric car battery plant in Spain,2022-10-19,"MADRID, Oct 19 (Reuters) - Slovakian battery manufacturer InoBat said on Wednesday it had signed a declaration of intent with the Spanish government to set up an electric vehicle battery factory in the city of Valladolid in central Spain.

The declaration is not a finalised agreement and other locations, including the United Kingdom, remain under consideration for its Western European gigafactory, the company added in a statement, explaining that it plans to make a decision on the location before the end of the year.

According to the Spanish Industry Ministry, the plant is expected to cost 3 billion euros ($2.94 billion) and would create more than 2,000 direct jobs.

InoBat, which has a plant in Slovakia and has announced another planned site in the U.S. state of Indiana, considers Valladolid an attractive location due to its wealth of talent, access to renewable energy, proximity to equipment manufacturers and strong transport links.

It would be the fourth car battery project in Spain, although its viability will depend on whether it qualifies for a portion of European COVID-19 pandemic recovery funds that Spain has earmarked for electric cars and batteries manufacturing.

Spain has a partnership agreement with Chinese green energy company Envision Group to build a battery plant for electric cars in Extremadura, developed jointly with Spanish renewable power company Acciona Energia (ANE.MC).

German carmaker Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE) and its partners plan to invest 7 billion euros in a factory in Valencia.

A group known as BASQUEVOLT also plans to build a plant in the Basque Country, where the regional government, Iberdrola (IBE.MC), CIE Automotive (CIEA.MC) and Enagas (ENAG.MC), are among the shareholders.

InoBat to build battery factory in Valladolid,2022-10-20,"InoBat Auto has signed a letter of intent with Spanish authorities to build a factory in Valladolid. At the same time, however, the Slovakian battery manufacturer itself relativises the significance of the document by affirming that other locations in Western Europe are still in the running.

Already in spring, InoBat had announced that it would build its third plant for electric car batteries in Western Europe and that it would decide on a location by the end of the year. The two other factories are a pilot plant with 100 MWh that has been put into operation in the meantime and a planned production facility with 10 GWh in Slovakia.

Despite the declaration of intent, InoBat apparently does not want to commit itself to Spain. The company emphasises that the signed document is not yet a firm agreement and that sites in the UK are still being considered for the factory. The signing of the letters of intent is intended to ensure that if Spain is selected, InoBat will have the necessary permits and government support to move the project forward quickly. InoBat Auto plans to make a final decision on the location of its battery factory in Western Europe later this year.

In the summer, the Slovaks had also announced that they wanted to examine battery assembly and cell production in the USA. Together with the US company Ideanomics, which specialises in e-commercial vehicles, InoBat says it is planning a three-stage project for the development and production of batteries in the US state of Indiana.

InoBat’s business model is based on quickly developing customised battery solutions for customer vehicles. This is currently being done on the basis of the company’s first generation of battery cells. This is an NCM622 pouch cell. Compared to a benchmark cell from Asia, it is said to be able to charge from five to 80 per cent 25 per cent faster, have a 20 per cent longer service life and offer 28 per cent better capacity retention at -20 degrees Celsius.

InoBat provides operational update following significant 2022 progress,,"InoBat provides operational update following significant 2022 progress

Battery manufacturing pilot line to be completed Q1 2023 with current workforce set to double when operational

Voderady to act as R&D epicentre in Slovakia, supporting planned portfolio of gigafactories in Europe and US

Significant partnerships and MOUs signed over the last year

Clear progress made towards future growth plans

London / Bratislava, 15 December 2022: InoBat (“InoBat” or the “Company”), the European pioneer of premium electric battery R&D, engineering, and production, today provides an operational update following the achievement of key development milestones this year and the significant progress made towards the Company’s future growth plans.

In summer 2021, InoBat began the construction of its EV battery R&D and pilot line facility on a brownfield site in Voderady, Slovakia. With a footprint of ~9,500 sqm, the site has progressed rapidly and now encompasses state-of-the-art laboratories, a dedicated R&D centre and a manufacturing pilot line, all on track to be commissioned in Q1 2023. The facility will be the epicentre of InoBat’s agile approach to product development, providing an “all-in-one” location solution – from chemistry research and cell development to battery production and recycling capability. This successfully showcases InoBat’s “cradle-to-cradle” circular economy approach in support of the Sustainable Development Goals of the UN (SDG 2030), which heavily influenced the decision to use an existing site to house InoBat’s first operations, reducing the need for carbon intensive construction methods.

The facility continues to progress swiftly and is on track to be up and running as planned in Q1 2023, with the production of tailor-made electric battery cells for InoBat’s customers set to begin shortly afterwards. With customer orders already signed, the facility’s current employee base will more than double to 150 as the site becomes fully operational, with one-third of the employee-base remaining entirely focused on R&D and product development. The facility will benefit significantly from Slovakia’s wealth of engineering talent and the intellectual capability developed at Voderady will sustain all of InoBat’s future sites.

This is only the first stage of development, however, as InoBat’s modular approach will enable the scale up of the plant in stages to ensure its expansion is in line with offtake demand, allowing the initial ~45MWh per annum capability to grow to gigafactory scale in a considered manner. As well as ensuring future capacity can be added smoothly without interrupting operations, this approach will also support production flexibility and the future-proofing of InoBat’s operations as processes evolve.

InoBat’s significant progress builds on the foundations that were carefully laid at its creation in 2019, with much of the past three years focused on investing in its own proprietary R&D, taking the view that European companies must develop their own ideas if they are to compete with established international manufacturers in Asia. For InoBat, it has been key to take a customer-focused approach and concentrate on creating the right product for customer needs before building very large, giga scale manufacturing facilities. Collaboration is key for success and, importantly, InoBat has already signed customer agreements with players in the commercial vehicle industry and the electric vertical take-off and landing aircraft sector, with the first cells already shipped and $2 million of initial revenues realised. In addition, InoBat benefits from an extensive further pipeline and is currently in discussions with 30+ parties.

Marian Bocek, CEO of InoBat Auto, commented: “I am incredibly pleased with the progress that has been made since we began developing our Voderady site just over a year ago. What was once a disused building is now an advanced research, development, and production facility with a top calibre R&D and operations team, all sitting under one roof.

“At the heart of our success is InoBat’s truly differentiated approach to produce tailor-made EV battery solutions, understanding that no two customers’ needs are alike. Our bespoke batteries provide customers with longer range, longer lifecycle, higher energy density and faster charging time – and most importantly, we develop our products first before scaling up our manufacturing capability. With tailor-made products for key customers under our belt, supported by an excellent R&D and operational team, we have all we need to succeed and will continue to drive forward on our journey to become a leading player in green mobility.”

The significant progress of InoBat’s Voderady facility is just the first operational step towards a global ambition to drive the transition towards EV mobility whilst localising value-chains through local partnerships and alliances. InoBat currently has a portfolio of projects under development in Europe and the US with plans that will see InoBat develop a network of sites and, eventually, gigafactories, with local partners. This important step began in June 2022, when InoBat announced plans – along with cornerstone investor, Ideanomics, and the State of Indiana – to develop a new facility in Indiana. This was swiftly followed by the announcement of InoBat’s planned site in Serbia, with support from the Government of Serbia and IFC. InoBat will also soon be announcing the location of the company’s third gigafactory, planned for Western Europe, with declarations of intent signed with authorities in Spain although other locations, such as the UK, remain under consideration.

These three gigafactories – one in Eastern Europe (Serbia), one in Western Europe (location to be confirmed) and one in the US (Indiana) – will all be developed in a phased approach aligned with offtake demand, in 4GWh modules until they reach full-scale gigafactories. These future facilities will be supported by the intellectual capability produced at InoBat’s existing Voderady site as well as its first UK site at the University of Warwick Science Park’s Warwick Innovation Centre.
