Northvolt to build third gigafactory in northern Germany,2022-03-15 06:11:47+00:00,"Northvolt signs Memorandum of Understanding with the north German state of Schleswig-Holstein and the region of Heide for the development of a 60 GWh lithium-ion battery manufacturing plant

The gigafactory, Northvolt Drei, is to employ 3,000 persons and produce its first batteries in late 2025

Powered by the cleanest electricity grid in Germany, Northvolt Drei is positioned to produce the cleanest batteries in continental Europe

Stockholm/Heide â Today Northvolt announces its intention to establish a battery gigafactory in Heide, Schleswig-Holstein, northern Germany. With an annual potential production capacity of 60 GWh, Northvolt Drei will deliver a supply of sustainably produced lithium-ion batteries to the European market, sufficient for some one million electric vehicles.

The new gigafactory increases Northvoltâs pipeline of battery manufacturing capacity under development to over 170 GWh, thereby advancing the company on its mission to deliver batteries in a manner characterized by clean energy and circularity that is fundamentally different from approaches dominating the global industry today.

Peter Carlsson, Co-Founder and CEO of Northvolt, comments: âWeâre excited to announce Northvolt Drei â a project which fits well into a promising future cluster of clean technology ventures emerging in northern Germany and advances the wider European transition towards a sustainable society within which Germany plays a crucial role.â

Envisioned to produce its first batteries in 2025 and provide some 3,000 new jobs, a central intention of Northvolt Drei is to deliver high-performance lithium-ion batteries, produced with the lowest environmental footprint in continental Europe.

The selection of Heide, Schleswig-Holstein, is key to fulfilment of this objective. The region hosts the cleanest energy grid in Germany, one which is characterized by a surplus of electricity generated by onshore and offshore wind power and reinforced by clean energy provided through grid interconnections to Denmark and Norway.

âIt matters how we produce a battery cell. If you use coal in your production, you embed a fair amount of CO2 into your battery, but if we use clean energy, we can build a very sustainable product. Our philosophy is that new energy-intensive industries, such as battery manufacturing, should be established in actual geographical proximity to where the clean energy is produced,â says Peter Carlsson.

It is not only an abundance of clean energy which positions the region of Heide and broader industrial landscape surrounding Hamburg as ideally suited to hosting Northvoltâs expanding presence in Europe.

In addition to being centrally positioned in the emerging European battery supply chain connecting Scandinavia and continental Europe, the region also provides the space required to establish a battery plant of sufficient size to leverage the economies of scale in production which are key to reducing battery costs.

Access to German industrial competence and automotive expertise will provide additional opportunities. Local manufacturing expertise of the Schleswig-Holstein region and Heide will ensure the factory is delivering batteries of the highest quality, while the factory itself will provide critical labor force experience with battery technology â an emerging cornerstone technology of the European economy.

With sustainability at the forefront of design and decision-making surrounding Northvolt Drei, the factory will source significant volumes of its raw material requirements from recycled battery metals, as part of Northvoltâs commitment to source 50 percent of its raw material needs from recycling by 2030.

Alongside battery production, Northvolt Drei will target an on-site battery recycling plant which will ensure efficient reuse of byproducts from the production process and provide a sustainable solution for end-of-life electric vehicle batteries recovered from European markets.

Across the full scope of the project, Northvolt is eager to bring the companyâs commitment to transparency and straightforwardness into its dealings with external stakeholders. That approach has proven successful in Sweden, in Norway and in Poland, and there is every reason to believe it will underpin delivery of another project with Northvolt Drei.

Christofer Haux, interim CEO of Northvolt Drei, comments: âWe look forward to engaging with communities and authorities of Schleswig-Holstein to ensure that Northvolt Drei is developed in a transparent and collaborative manner that makes the most of the many opportunities the project represents for the region.â

Northvolt receives funding approval for battery plant in Heide,2023-12-04 00:00:00,"In total, the decision that has now been handed over involves funding of around 700 million euros. Of this, around 564 million euros will be provided by the federal government and around 136 million euros by the state of Schleswig-Holstein. The funding is spread over several annual tranches but is still subject to approval by the European Commission under state aid law.

According to the German Federal Economics Minister Robert Habeck, his ministry requested an exemption from the budget freeze for the release of funds, which was granted by the Ministry of Finance. We remember: just one month before the ruling of the Federal Constitutional Court, which led to the budget freeze, the German government’s Budget Committee had decided to assume liability for a convertible bond to locate Northvolt’s battery cell factory in Schleswig-Holstein.

The convertible bond secured by the federal government is intended to support the project over and above the already approved IPCEI funding of around 155 million euros. The funding is to be provided on the basis of the EU’s new “Temporary Crisis and Transition Framework” (TCTF). The EU Commission must therefore still approve the funding. If this is the case, the TCTF will be applied in Germany for the first time.

The planned Northvolt Drei battery factory in Heide was announced in March 2022. Construction was scheduled to begin in 2025, with 3,000 jobs to be created in the final phase. The production capacity is 60 GWh, which should be enough for one million electric cars. In addition to battery production, Northvolt is also aiming to build a battery recycling plant on-site. Less than two months later, in May 2022, the company received the IPCEI funding decision for the aforementioned 155 million euros.

There is now talk of commissioning in 2026. Northvolt itself brought the high energy prices into play and is also pushing ahead with a factory project in Canada to benefit from the subsidies there and the demand due to the Inflation Reduction Act in the USA. However, both the company and politicians have always emphasized that the goal remains to build the factory in Schleswig-Holstein.

According to the FAZ, the project has an investment volume of 4.5 billion euros. The company has already invested around 100 million euros of its own funds in the construction project in Heide.

“Securing the funding for Northvolt is an important step towards triggering a major private investment that will create added value and jobs in an industry of the future,” said Habeck at the presentation of the funding decision. “And it is good that we were able to obtain the exemption from the budget freeze.”

Germany: Northvolt makes progress on cell plant in Heide,2023-05-12 00:00:00,"Swedish battery cell manufacturer Northvolt is making progress in setting up a factory in Germany. The communities of Lohe-Rickelshof and Norderwöhrden have agreed to enter the next phase of the approval process. In addition, Northvolt is seeking what is known as TCTF funding.

This is according to a joint announcement by the German Federal Ministry of Economy, the Schleswig-Holstein state government and Northvolt. Specifically, the above-mentioned municipalities decided to initiate the next phase of the approval process, described in the communication as “an important milestone on the way to the future start of construction”. Other steps planned for 2023 are preparing the ground for the construction of the factory and obtaining the final building permit.

Lohe-Rickelshof and Norderwöhrden are located near Heide, a town of 20,000 people in northern Germany that will be the official address of the Northvolt factory. The first batteries are expected to leave the plant in 2026. Once the factory is fully ramped up, the annual production capacity will be 60 GWh – enough to supply around one million electric vehicles with battery cells made in Germany.

In addition to the existing IPCEI funding, all parties involved – i.e. Northvolt and public representatives at various levels – are applying for funding based on the new Temporary Crisis and Transition Framework (TCTF), which the EU Commission must then approve. According to the statement, the German government and the EU Commission have already begun constructive talks. If the EU Commission approves the grant, it will be the first project in Germany to receive TCTF funding. It would unleash billions in private investment and create 3,000 jobs in Heide and thousands more in the industry and service sector.

“With the new TCTF, the EU-Commission opened up a clear path towards securing important industrial investments in Europe in key green technologies”, says German Economics Minister Robert Habeck. “We have been in negotiations with Northvolt since almost one year. Our trustful dialogue with the company and all relevant stakeholders has proven successful, and important next steps towards realization of the project therefore can now be taken.”

Peter Carlsson, founder and CEO of Northvolt, says: “We’re grateful for all the efforts being made by the Federal Government, the state government of Schleswig-Holstein, the EU-Commission but also made on local level in the district of Dithmarschen. Backed by this commitment of the federal government, Northvolt has decided to take the next steps towards our expansion in Heide.”

Northvolt initially announced in March 2022 that it planned to start production at the Heide factory in Schleswig-Holstein in 2025. Then in October, the company warned of a possible delay. Now, the plant will be ready in 2026.

However, it is now also clear that Northvolt does not want to put its plans for a German factory on hold because of US subsidies. A spokesman for the company told Reuters that Northvolt could build the factory in Germany, as well as another one in North America. However, this has not yet been set in stone. It was recently rumoured that Northvolt could build its North American factory in the Canadian province of Quebec.

Northvolt in 2022: where we stand,2022-03-29 10:37:13+00:00,"It is now plain to see that electric vehicles will come to occupy the majority share of new car sales in just a few decades time. Electric vehicle sales in the first quarter of 2021 rose by 140% compared to the same period in 2020. By 2030, this number is expected to be 15-25 times higher yet. Meanwhile, renewable energy has become the default option for new generating capacity in Europe.

The dynamics in play impact all corners of industry and society in an uncountable number of ways, but what is constant is widespread and tremendous demand for lithium-ion batteries.

Ten years ago, there was little conversation at all of Europe engaging in the enterprise of establishing its own battery industry to support this new industrial revolution. Today, that domestic battery industry is taking root â valued in excess of â¬250 billion by 2025 and a regular talking point of European politicians and automotive leaders alike.

Already today, itâs almost inconceivable to imagine that at one time Europe never considered moving in the direction itâs now taking, such is how quickly the battery industry has emerged into the fabric of new European industry.

Establishing a new, sustainable battery industry for Europe from a blank slate, as is Northvoltâs mission, was always going to be a monumental task. But the progress to date speaks volumes for the momentum for systemic change exhibited by industry amidst the climate crisis.",https://northvolt.com/articles/northvolt-2022-where-we-stand/

Swedish battery company Northvolt revealed plans to build its third battery gigafactory, which will be located in Heide in the German state of Schleswig-Holstein.

The factory in northern Germany dubbed as Northvolt Drei will see an investment of around €4bn, as per Germany Trade & Invest.

It will potentially produce 60GWh of lithium-ion batteries per annum. The capacity is enough to provide batteries for nearly a million electric vehicles (EVs) in the European market, said Northvolt.

The new gigafactory of Northvolt is its first outside Sweden.

According to Northvolt, the new facility boosts its pipeline of battery manufacturing capacity under development to more than 170GWh.

Northvolt co-founder and CEO Peter Carlsson said: “We’re excited to announce Northvolt Drei – a project which fits well into a promising future cluster of clean technology ventures emerging in northern Germany and advances the wider European transition towards a sustainable society within which Germany plays a crucial role.”

The Swedish battery company aims to produce its first batteries at the German facility in 2025. The project is expected to generate nearly 3,000 new jobs.

Heide’s selection for the battery gigafactory has been made because it hosts the cleanest energy grid in Germany, said the company. This is characterised by a surplus of power produced by onshore and offshore wind farms and strengthened by clean energy delivered via grid interconnections to Denmark and Norway.

Carlsson said: “It matters how we produce a battery cell. If you use coal in your production, you embed a fair amount of CO2 into your battery, but if we use clean energy, we can build a very sustainable product.

“Our philosophy is that new energy-intensive industries, such as battery manufacturing, should be established in actual geographical proximity to where the clean energy is produced.”

Apart from the production of batteries, the Northvolt Drei gigafactory will pursue an on-site battery recycling plant to ensure efficient reuse of byproducts from the production process. This will give a sustainable solution for end-of-life EV batteries recovered from Europe, said the company.

Last month, Northvolt in partnership with Volvo Cars said that a new battery manufacturing plant will be built in Gothenburg, Sweden with an investment of around $3.3bn.",https://www.nsenergybusiness.com/news/northvolt-battery-gigafactory-heide-germany/
