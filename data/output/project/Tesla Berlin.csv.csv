Tesla reveals plan for Gigafactory Berlin expansion with battery production and more,2023-07-19,"Tesla has revealed its plan for Gigafactory Berlin expansion with battery production and more, as it seeks approval for the plan.

Gigafactory Berlin is Tesla’s first full-scale factory in Europe.

It is now producing over 5,000 Model Y vehicles per week, but the automaker always had much bigger plans for the factory.

Tesla is currently approved for the production of 500,000 cars per year at the plant.

Now the automaker has submitted plans for a significant expansion that would allow for the production of 1 million vehicles per year and 100 GWh of battery production.

Here are the new plans for Tesla Gigafactory Berlin:

The new plan also includes a water recycling facility, a new logistics area, more battery storage, solar roof, and something called “solar roof charging.”

The new expansion would happen in three stages with the first one being operational in the first half of 2024 if it is approved.

However, Tesla has had some delays in receiving approval the first time around and the same could happen again.",https://electrek.co/2023/07/19/tesla-reveals-plan-gigafactory-berlin-expansion-battery-production/
Tesla's Gigafactory in Germany ready to roll – DW – 03,,"The plant, located just outside Berlin, will eventually produce 500,000 electric vehicles annually as well as batteries for the cars.

Tesla's plant was officially opened Tuesday in the presence of CEO Elon Musk and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz. Musk ceremoniously handed over the first Model Y cars to customers.

Before Giga Berlin secured a final permit from regional authorities earlier this month, Tesla had achieved something that was unheard of in recent German corporate history.

It had almost completely built a plant big enough to truly deserve the brand name Gigafactory, relying solely on a long string of about 20 different preliminary permits.

There had always been the chance of a final permission not being granted, which would certainly have caused chaos and required the company to remove everything they'd built. It was a huge risk, but CEO Elon Musk just pushed ahead.

The preliminary permits had enabled Musk's company to start the project with the logging of the surrounding forest areas some two years ago. Then came the building of the actual plant segments, which were eventually populated with state-of-the-art technology, including industrial robots.

Tesla started construction work at the site in Grünheide near Berlin in May 2020, meaning that only around 22 months have passed since then. Had it been up to the chief executive, the plant would have been inaugurated much earlier. Musk said delays along the way had to be attributed to notorious German red tape.

Environmental concerns remain

Germans, however, felt the project had advanced with lightning speed. For some, it had progressed way too fast as they felt — despite several rounds of public hearings — that their environmental concerns, especially fears about excessive water consumption at the plant, had not been dealt with properly.

The most recent delays were due to unfinished assessments of Tesla's concepts for sewage treatment, as well as contingency and emergency plans. These included how the company would deal with any potential leakage of hazardous chemicals.

""After one year, Tesla decided to also build a battery factory there, meaning that the approval process had to start from the beginning — so the whole process didn't actually take too long considering the difficult issues involved,"" Hubertus Bardt from the German Economic Institute told DW.

In comparison, Tesla's factory in Shanghai, which is about the same size as Giga Berlin, took only 15 months to complete. In terms of granting permits for comparable projects, that was a record even by Chinese standards, as authorities there admitted back in 2019.

Decisive year for Tesla

Late last year, the electric car manufacturer had been allowed to expand preliminary tests at its new factory in Grünheide.

The regional environment office for the state had approved the application for a functional test with up to 2,000 more car bodies on top of the 250 agreed on earlier. Tesla was allowed to build the cars for testing, but not to sell them. Now it's a different ball game.

Production is set to be accelerated in the second half of 2022.Tesla may produce roughly 30,000 units in the first six months. Eventually, it aims to put out half a million cars there per year.

So far, Model Y fully-electric vehicles for the European market have come exclusively from Tesla's Shanghai plant, but this will change once Berlin is up and running.

For Musk, Giga Berlin is of strategic importance. Together with a new factory in Austin, Texas, he hopes to see Tesla become a real mass producer of electric cars in the course of the year. The US car manufacturer could be able to produce 1.3 million units globally in 2023. If it succeeds, it would leave behind such renowned brands as Volvo and Mitsubishi and be on a level playing field with Volkswagen's Skoda.

Jobs and revenues

Regional politicians see Giga Berlin as the most significant investment project across eastern Germany, and have pinned great hope on the factory's long-term economic effects.

The state of Brandenburg, which surrounds Berlin, is economically underdeveloped, with agriculture and above all mining being the most important sources of income, apart from tourism. But coal mining is to be phased out and new employment opportunities are desperately needed.

The Tesla plant in Grünheide will eventually employ 12,000 people, up from over 2,000 right now, according to IG Metall trade union estimates. Not many of them come from Brandenburg itself right now, but more jobs will be created if the state succeeds in turning the region into a future mobility and energy transition hub. Aspirations on all sides are high.

Battery cells made in-house

Tesla claims Giga Berlin will be the company's most advanced and efficient facility yet. Apart from manufacturing Model Y cars at record speed, the Grünheide premise will also include a battery cell production plant meant to be the world's largest such facility.

Musk has indicated the plant will have an annual production capacity of up to 100 gigawatt hours (GWh) in an initial stage, which may later be expanded to 200 GWh. But even the planned capacity at the start would be enough to produce batteries for well over 1 million Model Y cars.

Experts expect Tesla to produce a new generation of 80 by 60 millimeter cells, promising higher energy density. Eventually, that would mean that the cars could extend their current range by 16%.

Request for EU subsidies withdrawn

To the big surprise of many, Tesla in November withdrew its application for subsidies for its Grünheide battery plant, thus renouncing a sum that could have been as high as €1 billion ($1.13 billion). Was that just a noble gesture?

Tesla itself has recently said it wanted to protect its battery cell know-how with the move.

In addition, the Financial Times dug out a clause that might have been another plausible reason for Musk's move.

In line with subsidies rules within the EU's Important Project of Common European Interest program, enterprises are not entitled to receive funding for technologies that they're already using at other facilities, meaning the battery cells cannot already be made at another Tesla plant.

When Tesla announced its battery plans for Germany, it hoped the plant could be operational fast enough to be the first of its kind globally. But various delays at Giga Berlin seem to have thwarted that plan, given that the US carmaker is now deploying the same technology at its factories in Texas and Shanghai.

Any real competition in sight?

It's undisputed that Tesla doesn't depend on subsidies to compete with the big names in the German auto industry.

Volkswagen, BMW and Daimler with its Mercedes brand will have a hard time catching up with Tesla's advanced e-mobility concepts and technology as they jumped on the bandwagon rather late. Nevertheless, Tesla's German competitors are now hard at work electrifying their product range, and they have a lot more experience in mass-producing cars.

But for mass production to make sense, you need masses of people who can afford electric cars. So far, neither Tesla nor any German manufacturers have anything on offer for the not-so-affluent, particularly if carmakers would have to sell their e-models without the current state subsidies in place for buyers.

This goes for Tesla's Model Y in particular, which currently sells for over €55,000 in Germany.

Tesla officially applies to build battery cells at Gigafactory Berlin,2021-06-04,"Tesla has officially applied to manufacture battery cells at Gigafactory Berlin. It’s expected to be among the first locations to produce Tesla’s new 4680 cell.

At its “Battery Day” earlier this year, Tesla unveiled its own battery cell, the Tesla 4680, and explained its plan to produce its own battery cells for the first time.

Tesla is currently ramping up production at its pilot production line in Fremont, California.

As we previously reported, Tesla has designed the entire production system called Roadrunner in-house, and it’s currently using the production line to improve on its machinery with the goal to deploy a full-scale factory using the production system.

Tesla is believed to be planning to deploy these full-scale battery cell factories at its current Gigafactory projects in Berlin, Texas, and China.

Based on how construction has been progressing, it looks like the battery factory in Berlin could be among the first to be ready.

Now we learn that Tesla has officially applied to the state of Brandenburg for approval for battery production at the factory (via RBB24 and translated from German):

The electric car manufacturer Tesla has officially applied to the state of Brandenburg for approval under emission control law for the production of battery cells in Grünheide (Oder-Spree) as ancillary equipment for vehicle production. The US group has completely revised its application documents and submitted them to the State Office for the Environment, the Environment Ministry announced on Thursday.

As part of the updated application, Tesla also reportedly added to body lines and revised down its expected water consumption at the plant.

CEO Elon Musk has previously disclosed that Tesla plans to deploy between 100 and 250 GWh of battery production capacity at Gigafactory Berlin:

I think it will possibly be the largest battery cell plant in the world. I think it will be the largest. It will be capable of over 100 GWh per year and possibly over time, it will be going over 200 to 250 GWh. I’m pretty confident that at that point, it will be the largest battery cell plant in the world.

Tesla is going to need those cells for its Model Y production at the plant, but the automaker did say that it would initially use its battery cells produced in Fremont to support production.",https://electrek.co/2021/06/04/tesla-officially-applies-build-battery-cells-gigafactory-berlin/

Once Tesla’s new Berlin Gigafactory starts cranking out battery packs, it’s going to require plenty of lithium, among other raw materials. We don’t know to what extent Tesla is working with German industrial planners, but we do know that European policymakers have a strategy to establish all the key elements of a local supply chain for the growing EV industry. So, it’s unlikely to be a coincidence that a lithium processing facility is planned for a location very near the Gigafactory.

Rock Tech Lithium, a company with offices in Canada and Germany, is planning to build a production plant for battery-grade lithium hydroxide in Guben, Brandenburg. The company has acquired a 12-hectare site in the Guben South industrial park, just a few miles away from the Gigafactory site in Grünheide.

Rock Tech intends to locate all production steps of lithium refining in one plant at the Guben site, which it envisions as part of an “e-mobility cluster” taking shape in the Brandenburg region. The company plans to invest up to 470 million euros in the new plant, which is expected to employ some 160 technicians, engineers and production staff. Projected annual production is 24,000 metric tons of lithium hydroxide, enough to equip around 500,000 EVs.

We are thrilled to announce the achievement of a major milestone in Rock Tech Lithium's history today: We are planning Europe's first lithium hydroxide converter in Guben, Germany. #Cleantech #Brandenburg pic.twitter.com/DpwJwOpOva — Rock Tech Lithium (@RockTechLithium) October 11, 2021

The converter is scheduled to start operations in 2024. Locally sourced renewable energy is to be used for production. By 2030, the company plans to obtain around 50 percent of the raw materials it uses from recycling spent batteries.

“We are becoming the lithium partner of the automotive industry, and are building our own, previously non-existent infrastructure for battery-grade lithium hydroxide in Europe,” said Rock Tech CEO Dirk Harbecke. “Our goal is to be the first company worldwide to create a closed loop for lithium. Guben seems to us to be the ideal location for this, with subsidies also playing a significant role.”

“With Rock Tech Lithium, we are strengthening our position as the future center of European e-mobility,” said Jörg Steinbach, Minister for Economic Affairs, Labor and Energy of the State of Brandenburg. “Brandenburg will be home to the entire value chain in the future, from raw material processing to battery and cell production to e-car construction as well as battery recycling.”

"Tesla aims to double production capacity in German Gigafactory, targeting 1 million EVs annually",2023-07-21,"By AFP & Euronews

If Tesla's plans are approved, the site will become Germany's largest automotive plant, ahead of Volkswagen's historic stronghold in Wolfsburg.

US carmaker Tesla has submitted an application to double the production capacity of its German plant, aiming to manufacture 1 million electric vehicles annually, the company and local authorities said this week.

The factory, known as Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg, is situated approximately 30 kilometres southeast of Berlin.

In addition to doubling vehicle production from its current 500,000 vehicles a year, Tesla is seeking approval to expand its battery cell manufacturing capabilities at the same plant, raising the current battery storage capacity of 50 gigawatt-hours to 100-gigawatt hours per year.

If Tesla's plans are approved, the site will become Germany's largest automotive plant, according to the German business newspaper Handelsblatt, positioning itself ahead of Volkswagen's historic stronghold in Wolfsburg, which boasts a production capacity of 800,000 vehicles a year.

Tesla's rapid expansion in Grünheide, where the Gigafactory is located, has already significantly impacted the German automotive industry since it began production 16 months ago. Over the first half of 2023, Tesla surpassed Volkswagen in electric vehicle sales for the first time.

At present, however, the American electric vehicle manufacturer is still a long way from fully utilising its German plant, which opened in March 2022.

Currently, the plant only produces 5,000 units per week, resulting in an annual output of approximately 260,000 vehicles.

To seek public input on the expansion of the Gigafactory, the authorities of Brandenburg, the state where the Tesla factory is situated, have initiated a public consultation process online. Citizens have two months to comment on the project.

Early this year, the first phase of the plant's construction was delayed due to the high number of objections from locals, who were primarily opposed to itswater consumption.

This time around, the company has implemented a more refined strategy. On Tuesday, Tesla workers actively interacted with local residents, focusing on a range of topics, including water use, biodiversity protection, and the environmental impact assessment related to the proposed expansion.

The US car company has long argued that the plant's impact is relatively low and referred to the benefits of EVs in combating climate change. A spokesman also told AFP that Tesla was planning to ""optimise"" the process of recovering and purifying the water, so as not to increase the quantities of fresh water required.

Expansion of the Gigafactory is to be phased in gradually, with three partial permit applications planned.

""We have to ensure that the effects of the construction and operation of the plant are compatible with the environment,"" a spokeswoman for the Brandenburg Ministry of the Environment told AFP.

A big push for German workers

According to Tesla, the Gigafactory currently employs more than 10,000 workers, and the company envisions that the workforce could potentially reach 22,500 employees in the near future.

“Join us at Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg to solve the next generation of engineering, manufacturing and operational challenges as we accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy,” Tesla’s website states, noting that they are “currently hiring across a wide variety of skill and experience levels—no automotive experience necessary”.

Will France be left aside?

French President Emmanuel Macron met Tesla CEO Elon Musk in May to discuss ""the attractiveness of France and its industries”.

And in December last year, Macron and Musk also met in New Orleans during the French president's visit to the United States.

They had, according to the latter, ""a clear and sincere discussion"" and exchanged on ""future green industrial projects such as the production of electric vehicles and batteries"".

Macron has recently announced a series of measures to support innovative industries and transition towards greener technology. They include tax credits in fields like battery production, electric cars, hydrogen, and wind power, as well as accelerating authorisations for industrial projects.

""France is changing, is getting adapted to the course of the world, and I believe that we're following the right path, which is to reindustrialise the country, to be more sovereign and more respectful of the climate and biodiversity,"" Macron said on Friday during a visit to Dunkirk, in northern France.

However, whether France will successfully secure a Tesla factory in its territory remains uncertain.",https://www.euronews.com/next/2023/07/21/tesla-aims-to-double-production-capacity-in-german-gigafactory-targeting-1-million-evs-ann
Tesla applies for battery factory at new German plant – DW – 06,,"Tesla has also changed its application for emission control approval for its construction plans. The new application formally requests the additional battery production facility Tesla had already hinted at.

US carmaker Tesla has expanded its application for construction permits to build more facilities in Grünheide — south of Berlin — notably a battery factory.

In April, Tesla said it wanted to include a battery production facility in its permit application.

Given the scope of the changes, the state of Brandenburg's ministry of agriculture, environment and climate (MLUK) must decide in the next few days ""whether to involve the public again,"" the licensing authority said in a statement on Thursday .

The MLUK added it would first fully assess Tesla's latest application.

Altering planning requests for such large-scale projects ""is not unusual,"" the MLUK said, adding that the carmaker had the right to amend its application at any time.

So far, Tesla is only building on the basis of preliminary building permits but construction of Elon Musk's planned ""Gigafactory"" in Grünheide is already well underway.

The car manufacturer originally planned to start production at its first European plant in the summer.

Following criticism from environmental groups, Tesla also wants to introduce various measures to reduce water consumption so that despite expansion of the plant, water consumption is still expected to be about 1.4 million cubic meters per year.



Legal and environmental obstacles

In December, the Berlin-Brandenburg Higher Administrative Court ruled that Tesla could not cut down trees in certain sections of a forest.

The court banned the carmaker from clearing the peripheral areas of its site, upholding an emergency appeal by environmental groups.

However, the court added that a stoppage in the rest of the area was unjustified and that Tesla could proceed, albeit with restrictions, to start the construction of its plant in Grünheide.

Tesla construction had been blocked for the second time in December after briefly getting the green light from a lower court to continue clearing the forest.

Environmental backlash

Conservation groups Grüne Liga (Green League) and Nature and Biodiversity Conservation Union (NABU) have opposed Tesla's planned construction, arguing that logging could endanger hibernating reptiles.

The case specifically focused on the well-being of the local smooth snakes(Coronella austriaca) and the sand lizard (Lacerta agilis), both of which are protected species in Germany.

Tesla carried out measures to relocate the species earlier this year, but the environmentalists say the efforts did not go far enough.

Tesla’s first full battery cell factory will produce up to 250 GWh — roughly the current world capacity,2020-11-24,"Tesla’s first full-scale battery cell factory, which is located at Tesla Gigafactory Berlin, will produce up to 250 GWh, according to new comments from Elon Musk.

That’s roughly the current world battery cell production capacity.

At its “Battery Day” earlier this year, Tesla unveiled its own battery cell, the Tesla 4680, and explained its plan to produce its own battery cells for the first time.

Tesla is currently ramping up production at its pilot production line in Fremont.

As we previously reported, Tesla has designed the entire production system called Roadrunner in-house, and it is currently using the production line to improve on its machinery with the goal to deploy a full-scale factory using the production system.

Tesla is believed to be planning to deploy these full-scale battery cell factories at its current Gigafactory projects in Berlin, Texas, and China.

Based on how construction has been progressing, it looks like the battery factory in Berlin is going to be the first one ready.

Last week, we reported on how Tesla started hiring for its battery cell factory at Gigafactory Berlin.

Now Elon Musk commented on what kind of battery capacity Tesla plans to deploy at the site in a new battery conference in Europe:

The CEO said about the new battery factory:

I think it will possibly be the largest battery cell plant in the world. I think it will be the largest. It will be capable of over 100 GWh per year and possibly over time, it will be going over 200 to 250 GWh. I’m pretty confident that at that point, it will be the largest battery cell plant in the world.

Bloomberg estimates that 250 GWh is just under the current world production capacity for li-ion battery cells — though that could more than double by the time Tesla reaches that kind of capacity at Gigafactory Berlin:

In order to achieve that kind of capacity, Musk said that Tesla still needs to improve its production processes at the pilot plant to achieve higher cycle time for the first full-scale factory in Berlin.

Tesla also needs to redesign some machinery for “continuous flow operation.”

As Tesla explained on battery day, the production processes developed for the automaker’s new battery cell are supposed to be more capital and energy efficient and also have a smaller carbon footprint — making the battery cells cleaner to produce.

Tesla hasn’t provided a clear timeline for the start of battery production at Gigafactory Berlin, but it is expected to start around the same time as vehicle production, which they officially aim to achieve in July 2021.

That’s because the automaker plans to use its new structural battery pack technology to produce the Model Y in Berlin and that requires the new 4680 battery cells.

However, Tesla said that it will support the production of the European Model Y with battery cell production at its pilot production facility.

Therefore, the timing for battery cell production at the new factory is not completely clear at this point.

Electrek’s Take

That’s a lot of battery cells.

100 GWh should be enough for the production of 1 million vehicles per year, which is expected to be the production capacity of Gigafactory Berlin by the time it reaches full capacity.

But Tesla could also produce electric semi trucks, which use more than 10 times the amount of batteries of an average electric car, and it could also produce battery cells for stationary storage applications like Powerwalls, Powerpacks, and Megapacks.

The battery factory could also supply other Tesla factories, but I think by the time Tesla can ramp up to over 100 GWh, it will also have battery cell production at other locations, which would make sense to lower logistical costs.
