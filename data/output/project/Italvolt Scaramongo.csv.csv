Italvolt – Electrifying the future,,"Italvolt has made a strategic decision to locate its battery cell factory in Italy, the country where Alessandro Volta invented the battery in 1800. Today, Italy holds significant opportunity for the modern battery industry, with its strategic location and highly skilled workforce.

Italy has a rich industrial heritage, especially as a hub of Europe’s automotive industry, offering access to a large, skilled workforce. The country’s geographical position offers access to key global markets, sitting at a strategic intersection of the east-west and north-south Mediterranean corridors.

Italvolt intends to honour Italy’s important industrial legacy by supporting the country’s green industrialisation ambitions, and by delivering battery cells which will help drive decarbonisation across a variety of industries.

Italvolt’s 45GWh battery plant will be the Italy’s largest, independent, battery cell factory. The battery cell factory will focus on creating new opportunities for re-skilling and upskilling workers from Italy’s automotive industry.

Italvolt will seek to create new centres of excellence based on advanced engineering and will focus on re-establishing Italy as a leading force in the modern industrial era, while supporting the wider transition to sustainable, battery powered solutions.",https://www.italvolt.com/
Italvolt signs Memorandum of Understanding for the Gigafactory of Scarmagno and Romano Canavese – Italvolt,2022-04-21 13:33:44+00:00,"The Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) for the project was presented by Italvolt S.p.A., the company founded by Swedish entrepreneur Lars Carlstrom, and signed today at the Piedmont Region headquarters.

The purpose of the MoU is to coordinate the actions and procedures of the signatories – the Piedmont Region, the Metropolitan City of Turin and the municipalities of Scarmagno, Romano Canavese and Ivrea – to ensure efficient administrative action concerning the construction of the Gigafactory, which will be built on the former Olivetti site in Scarmagno and Romano Canavese.

The Italvolt project plans to start the production of lithium-ion batteries in the second half of 2024 and it expects to employ up to 3,000 employees, on a total area of 1,000,000m2 to deliver a production capacity of 45 GWh. The Gigafactory of Scarmagno and Romano Canavese will secure Piedmont’s position as a hub for green industrialization and sustainable mobility, making Italy one of the largest producers of lithium-ion batteries for electric vehicles and energy storage in Europe.

“After the presentation of the preliminary project and the subsequent authorization obtained at the beginning of 2022, the signing of the Memorandum of Understanding confirms the progress of a project that is proceeding rapidly thanks to constant collaboration with all the local authorities. Respecting the shared timeline will lead us to become one of the first players in Europe to start production, thus ensuring Italvolt’s key role in the EV industry,” said Lars Carlstrom, Italvolt Founder and CEO.

“The signing of this protocol,” commented Piedmont Region President Alberto Cirio and Councillor for Economic Development Andrea Tronzano, “is a clear demonstration of how the Gigafactory in Scarmagno is becoming increasingly concrete. A punctual timetable that marks the approach of a project that will bring the benefits: development and employment; two fundamental successes for the territory and the Piedmontese economy in the strategic sectors, technology and automotive. This protocol is a classic example of the collaboration of a Piedmontese system that can grow and has a future.

“Città Metropolitana di Torino will play a crucial role in the plant’s authorisation process,” says Sonia Cambursano, the councillor responsible for economic development, “in synergy with the Piedmont Region and the municipalities. For us, networking is the best way to develop the area. In this project we see the possibility of achieving the objectives of employment and development in the Canavese area, but also of encouraging sustainable energy for mobility”.

“With the founder of Italvolt,” commented Stefano Sertoli, Mayor of the Municipality of Ivrea, “right from the first meeting in Ivrea, there was an immediate understanding that gave rise to a relationship of mutual respect and constant dialogue. I can only be pleased that the other entities involved, once they shared the project, also started an effective collaboration. The Memorandum of Understanding represents a fundamental step towards meeting the timetable for the realisation of an industrial plan that will mark an epoch-making step for our territory. The chosen location is certainly strategic, on the road axis leading from Italy to the centre of Europe. I am proud that this can go ahead”.

Elisabetta Piccoli, Deputy Mayor of the Municipality of Ivrea, added: “I have witnessed the birth of this very important project for our territory and the signing of the protocol makes me very happy because it represents a concrete action of synergy between the authorities that must proceed quickly alongside determined and courageous entrepreneurs like Lars Carlstrom. The increase of 3,000 jobs and the allied industries it would create is a goal we are all working towards together and in which we believe”.

“I believe I was the first mayor to meet Lars Carlstrom and Italvolt,” says Adriano Grassino, Mayor of the Municipality of Scarmagno. “I was struck by his determination and the project that he managed to get across in his words. The first question I asked him was about safety and the environment. The answer was comprehensive and immediate. He had already asked the question and found the solution by putting the issue at the forefront. Words were followed by deeds. The determination to proceed with the construction of the Gigafactory gradually took shape until the relevant entities agreed on the Memorandum of Understanding and the timetable, which is fundamental and indispensable for the construction of the industrial complex within a reasonable timeframe. An important and necessary project to restart the engine of the Canavese economy and the great and complex driving machine, the Piedmont Region. With Italvolt, Scarmagno would return to being one of the leading players in the national economy and perhaps even beyond its borders. A new and powerful boost would be given to employment and well-being in an exhausted area that absolutely needs it”.

“The Municipality of Romano Canavese”, commented Mayor Oscarino Ferrero, “considers the signing of the Memorandum of Understanding for the Italvolt Gigafactory to be an important moment for the development of a new economic reality and for the relaunch of the Canavese area which, despite having always been considered prosperous and home to large national companies, has recently suffered a loss of social and employment opportunities”.

In particular, given the significance and complexity of the project, the MoU provides for the establishment of a Technical Table of Coordination that will be chaired by a delegate of the Region with the task of coordinating and supporting the various institutional offices involved, with a view to efficient administrative action. In addition, considering the relevant public interest of the project and the timeframe for the start of production planned by Italvolt by 2024, the signatories are committed to make every reasonable effort to complete the procedure within seven months from the submission of the application, expected by June 2022.

The Piedmont Region, on behalf of all signatories, will also intensify the talks already started with the Ministry of Economic Development and other competent Ministries, in order to work alongside Italvolt in the identification of support and financing measures for the project, including those provided by the PNRR.

Italvolt itself adheres to the Memorandum of Understanding, as proponent of the initiative and the project. The Ivrea SUAP (Sportello unico attività produttive) is the body delegated to carry out the urban planning and building procedures related to the project and falling under the competence of the municipalities of Scarmagno and Romano Canavese.",https://www.italvolt.com/italvolt-signs-memorandum-of-understanding-for-the-gigafactory-of-scarmagno-and-romano-canavese-2/
Italvolt chooses the former Olivetti area of Scarmagno to build Italy’s first Gigafactory – Italvolt,2021-02-18 15:45:00+00:00,"Italvolt, founded and led by Lars Carlstrom, the businessman who has been pioneering the automotive industry with over 30 years of experience, announces they have chosen Scarmagno, where the Olivetti industrial area once stood, to build the first Gigafactory in Italy. The factory will be dedicated to the production and storage of lithium-ion batteries for electric vehicles. The first stage of the project, envisaging an overall investment of approximately 4 billion Euros, will be completed by Spring of 2024.

The former Olivetti area in Scarmagno, owned by the Monteverdi Fund managed by Prelios SGR, was selected by Italvolt because of its especially favorable technical features and strategic geographical position. Today, the site is a large decommissioned industrial lot that stands on an area of about 1 million square meters, chosen in the past for Olivetti by architects Marco Zanuso and Eduardo Vittoria because of its excellent road and rail connections with Ivrea and with the city of Turin. Another factor that makes Scarmagno ideal for Italvolt’s project is its strong bond with the productive capability of Piedmont, the leading region in Italy in automotive industrial production.

Italvolt’s Gigafactory, with its 300,000 m2 of floor space and an initial capacity of 45 GWh, is an important opportunity for the economic and industrial rebirth of the Scarmagno area and will have a significant impact on the region as well. It is estimated, in fact, that the plant will employ 4,000 workers and will create up to another 15,000 new jobs in allied activities.

The new plant, designed to be easily capable of meeting the growing demand for batteries in Europe that is expected to increase 17 times to approx. 3,600 gigawatt (GWh) by 2030, will be designed by the Architecture Division of Pininfarina, the iconic automotive design brand that has just recently celebrated its 90 years of activity and is already participating in other similarly large projects. With a strong focus on environmental and social impact, Pininfarina intends to develop a new-generation, intelligent and responsible industrial plant by applying DFMA construction methods and by opening the building out to its surroundings, making it merge into the economic and social fabric of the region. Comau, a world leader in industrial automation, with over 45 years of experience and strongly specialized in electrification processes, will be the supplier of innovative solutions, systems and technologies for the gigaplant.

Comau will also see to the construction of the Research & Development center that will be home to academic and industrial partners committed to the development of the most forward-thinking technologies in the electric mobility sector.

Lars Carlstrom, CEO and founder of Italvolt, claimed: “The support of the Piedmont Region, of the local government authorities and of the trade associations in the last eight months has been key to our decision-making process. We are especially happy with the opportunity of starting our project in Piedmont where we have found the perfect combination of factors that I believe are necessary for furthering the transition towards green industrialization: solid industrial tradition and highly specialized technological know-how in the automotive sector. Last but not least, we are honored that we will be able to build our Gigafactory in the Scarmagno area that was once occupied by the Olivetti industrial complex, a company that has written an important page of Italy’s industrial history and that today is still an icon of Made in Italy technology”.",https://www.italvolt.com/italvolt-chooses-the-former-olivetti-area-of-scarmagno-to-build-italys-first-gigafactory/

Strategic advancement of Italvolt's 45 GWh Gigafactory – Italvolt,2021-09-09 15:28:49+00:00,"Italvolt Spa, a company founded by Lars Carlstrom with the aim of building in Italy one of Europe’s largest gigafactories, has signed a binding agreement with Prelios Sgr, the agent managing the Monteverdi Fund, for the purchase of a 1 million m2 area in the municipality of Scarmagno (Turin), once the site of the Olivetti factory. Italvolt’s gigafactory for the production and storage of lithium-ion batteries for electric vehicles, which will have a production capacity of 45 GWh when fully operative, is one of the most important industrial projects in recent years in Italy, with a total investment of approximately EUR 3.4 billion.

The former Olivetti area of Scarmagno has been selected by Italvolt for its technical characteristics and its particularly strategic geographical location in terms of road and rail connections. Another factor that makes the former Olivetti area ideal for hosting Italvolt’s project is its strong link to the production fabric of Piedmont, Italy’s leading region in the automotive industry. The land will be reclaimed and redeveloped by Italvolt, with an area of 300 thousand m2 dedicated to the construction of the new plant, 20 thousand m2 of which will be used to build a Research& Development centre.

The next step for Italvolt is to obtain the building permits, expected by early 2022, so that work can begin in the second half of the year. The new plant will be designed by Pininfarina’s Architecture Division with a strong focus on its environmental and social impact. Pininfarina intends to design a new-generation industrial plant, integrated into the economic and social dynamics of the area.

Lars Carlstrom, CEO and Founder of Italvolt said: “The agreement with Prelios Sgr represents a key step in the implementation plan of our gigafactory project. We are very pleased to have concluded the purchase of the area within the time frame reconfirmed with the local and political institutions that in recent months have made a significant contribution to the promotion of Italvolt’s project. The decommissioned area has a great potential that we can give back to the local context by offering jobs and environmental requalification”.

The first half of 2021 has seen a strong acceleration of the electric mobility industry in Europe and globally. In Italy, for example, registrations of electric and plug-in hybrid cars quadrupled in the first six months of 2021 compared to the same period last year. Demand for lithium-ion batteries in Europe is expected to grow at a rate of 24% per year, led by e-mobility, exceeding 1,200 GWh in 2035. As things stand, considering the announced gigafactory openings in Europe, this would result in a production gap of more than 250 GWh.

Lars Carlstrom added: “We are proud to be the initiators of a project that will become the largest gigafactory in Southern Europe. We are confident that this will pave the way for new industrial initiatives dedicated to battery production in Italy. In order to reach the highly challenging goal proposed by the European Commission of completing the transition to a zero-emission automotive industry by 2035, battery production must be accelerated and Italvolt is ready to play its part”.

Patrick Del Bigio, CEO of Prelios Sgr, commented: “We are very pleased with the result achieved with this transaction, because the area that once hosted the historic Olivetti factory will come back to life in the coming months with a new industrial project focused on the business of electric mobility, which today is a highly strategic and innovative sector, just as Olivetti was in the 1960s in the IT sector. The industrial vocation of the site therefore remains solid, with the important socio-economic repercussions that will derive from it, fully consistent with a growing green perspective. With this awareness, Prelios SGR has also been particularly committed and has contributed to the success of the operation by working closely with representatives of the public administration and with all the other players involved, as well as defining the best value of the real estate asset”.

Andrea Tronzano, Councillor for the Budget of the Piedmont Region, said: “This is a moment of great advancement for Piedmont. This step is extraordinarily important for the Canavese area and beyond, and demonstrates Italvolt’s intent to build the battery factory on schedule. Piedmont wants a gigafactory and this news can only give us great pleasure. Now we will develop the business plan further in order to facilitate the dialogue with the Government for the resources of the Italian Recovery and Resilience Plan”.

The fulfilment of the agreement is subject to certain conditions precedent of an administrative kind and is expected within 12 months of its undersigning.

As for the legal aspects, Italvolt was assisted by Dentons, with a team led by Managing Partner Federico Sutti and comprises Partner Federico Vanetti and the Associates Lorenzo Ugolini and Cristina Garlaschelli, while Prelios Sgr was assisted by GDP – Studio Legale e Tributario with a team led by Founding Partner Prof. Andrea Gemma, with Partner Elisabetta Mattozzi and Managing Associate Chiara Adele Pero.",https://www.italvolt.com/a-binding-agreement-has-been-signed-for-the-purchase-of-the-former-olivetti-area-in-scarmagno-amounting-to-a-surface-area-of-1-million-square-metres/
Italvolt aims to build Italian EV battery plant in spring 2023,2022-08-17 00:00:00,"Lars Carlstrom, CEO of Italvolt and Statevolt and cofounder of Britishvolt, has revealed more details about Italvolt – the announced 45 GWh battery cell factory in the north-western Italian region of Piedmont. Carlstrom expects to receive the building permit in spring 2023.

According to the eeNews Europe interview with Carlstrom, the new factory will make MNC (nickel, manganese, cobalt) lithium-ion battery cells with silicon anodes for car makers to assemble into packs. Carlstrom also said that solid-state cells are also being considered and that the new plans envisage that the site will also include material factories and possibly even the processing of lithium. He said the plant will have over eight production lines, each with a capacity of 6 GWh.

“We are not going to make battery packs yet, we are only focussing on cells,” Carlstrom said. “The battery is the platform of the car and that has to be engineered by the car maker. To make all this happen it has to be a collaboration between cell manufacturer, car makers and the supply chain”

In the interview, Italvolt’s CEO said that production will start in 2025, with the company aiming to move into mass production in 2027 and 2028. All batteries will have at least a fast-charging function, Carlstrom adds, so that they can be charged in “five or six minutes, just like you fill up your car with petrol”. At full production, the factory should be able to produce cells for 550,000 cars but did not mention whether the factory is aiming to produce cells for other vehicle types.

Italvolt announced the construction project in February 2021, and signed a purchase agreement for the land in September of the same year. The site, which covers an area of around 100 hectares, is located in the municipality of Scarmagno in the northwestern Italian region of Piedmont. In September last year, the company indicated that 30 hectares will be used to build the plant and two hectares will be used to set up an R&D centre.

“As it is a brownfield project it makes it easier to get the permits. We will demolish 95% of the buildings, we are keeping two for the canteen and a small museum, that’s the agreement,” he said. “A gigafactory is very complex and difficult to engineer so you can’t use old buildings. Fires and explosions can take place so the buildings have to be engineered for this, so its probably ten times more expensive than other buildings and not many of these have been built in the world.”

Earlier this year, Lars Carlstrom announced another battery factory in the USA. The newly founded company Statevolt is to build a factory in Southern California’s Imperial Valley that will offer an annual capacity of 54 GWh when fully expanded, which should be enough for around 650,000 electric vehicles. Carlstrom also co-founded Britishvolt and was CEO until he stepped down.

Italvolt has already entered into a number of collaborations, such as with AECOM for the construction of dry rooms, AVL and ABB for electrification and connection to the electricity grid as well as automation and robots for the factory, TÜV SÜD for the control and certification of production processes and American Manganese for the recycling of lithium-ion batteries. Italvolt is also cooperating with the Polytechnic of Milan (Politecnico di Milano) on new battery technologies and recycling.

New Gigafactory could make ‘Italy one of Europe’s biggest electric vehicle battery producers’,2022-04-21 12:43:29+00:00,"Battery manufacturer Italvolt has signed a memorandum of understanding for its Gigafactory in Scarmagno, Italy, where it will deliver 45 GWh production capacity for battery cells.

By June 2022, the final design is expected to be submitted, construction permits are expected by early 2023 and production will start in 2024.

The Italvolt project plans to start the production of lithium-ion batteries in the second half of 2024 and it expects to employ up to three thousand employees, on a total area of one million square meters. The Gigafactory of Scarmagno and Romano Canavese will place Piedmont and Italy among the most important players of the green industrialization and sustainable mobility, making Italy one of the largest producers of batteries for electric vehicles in Europe.

Italvolt Selects ABB To Build 45 GWh Battery Gigafactory In Italy,,"Italvolt is another new player that would like to become a lithium-ion battery supplier for electric vehicles. The location wil be Scarmagno in Northern Italy.

The company, founded by Lars Carlstrom, intends to build a factory with an output of 45 GWh of batteries annually, which would be enough for about 550,000 EVs - according to the press release. The average capacity would be 82 kWh per vehicle.

""The gigafactory will be located at the famous Olivetti site and is being designed by iconic Italian automotive design house division Pininfarina Architecture. ""

This week, Italvolt announced that ABB was selected for Front End Engineering and Design (FEED) and that the two will partner on automation, electrification and digitalization solutions related to battery manufacturing.

""More specifically, the technology partnership with ABB will bring Italvolt: Expertise in design and delivery of electrification and automation solutions for power control, distribution and management, optimization of manufacturing processes and long-term energy efficiency

Consultancy on robotics and autonomous operations for transportation and handling of material in the process units of the plant

Exploration of solutions for data gathering, processing, cloud storage and analytics for production planning, quality control, management, operations and reporting""

It seems that now we have multiple new wanabe battery manufacturers in Europe, including Northvolt in Sweden, Britishvolt in the UK, Freyr in Norway (and maybe in U.S.), Verkor in France, and multiple joint ventures set up by carmakers, including Automotive Cells Company, Volkswagen's JVs or stand-alone projects (Tesla in Germany).

Considering that established battery manufacturers also are investing heavily in Europe, it already looks like a battery gold rush.

Italvolt’s giga factory set to power Europe’s future with green batteries,,"As Europe moves toward a low-carbon future, intending to realize green industrialization, many companies are planning mega factories to make batteries and revive the European supply chain. Lars Carlstrom, Founder, and CEO – Italvolt shares with Ashok Thakur, Chief Editor - ETN, his vision of building a mammoth EV battery plant in Scarmagno, Italy's erstwhile motor valley.

Lars Carlstrom, Founder, and CEO – Italvolt

Your particular choice of location, what inspired you to think giga factory, and the vision behind the decision to build one of such magnitude?

Firstly, my background in the automotive industry has been a great help. Secondly, and more importantly, the prospect of re-energizing by creating a large number of jobs and new opportunities in areas that were prosperous three or four decades ago has been a driving force behind the vision and the challenge. Reflected in the magnitude of what we are planning here in Italy - a 45GWh factory, the enterprise will provide around 3000 jobs; and once the supply chain is recreated, up to 10,000 new jobs will be created in the new integrated ecosystem-based on green industrialization. This is a huge opportunity to be a part of such a phenomenal and unprecedented transformation.

How important is site selection? What aspects does an entrepreneur like you consider regarding site location when building a giga factory?

Finding a suitable location is not an easy task. To begin with, you need a massive grid connection; you need to have at least 80 to 100 hectares of land and then get approvals for building permits. Paperwork can take a long time, so a good option would be to look at former industrial sites, as it would make it easier to get the permits. The site also needs to be logistically well located, ideally with access to the highway, maybe a rail connection, or a port close by. We are building our factory in Scarmagno near Turin, at the former Olivetti site. (Olivetti di Scarmagno came up long before the Silicon Valley; the Olivetti complex saw many amazing initiatives take shape that had a huge social impact at that time.) The location is a very interesting part of Europe's past, which makes it an exciting opportunity to be a part of it today. Also, Italy being a part of the EU, a lot of initiatives in the battery sector here are now being greatly supported. The Scarmagno site was selected as it already contains existing infrastructure and strategic geography for road and rail connections. Around 300,000 m2 will be reclaimed and repurposed for constructing the new plant, and 20,000 m2will be used for an R&D center being built by our engineering team. We are collaborating with the Politechnico University in Torino, to develop the most forward-thinking technology in the sector and add competence to Italvolt.

Italvolt giga factory

Which companies is Italvolt collaborating with, and what do they bring to the table?

Italvolt is partnering with Swedish technology company ABB for automation and electrification of the production process. Pininfarina, with whom we have had a long-standing collaboration from the time of BritishVolt, will be responsible for the architectural design of the new factory and lead the engineering works. Our collaboration with TÜV SÜD will certify all of our supply chain, technology, and production in the most responsible manner possible. We are focusing on creating an engineering model of the plant that can be more or less replicated at any site in the world. For technology development, rather than having our development that can be too costly, we are working on creating an IP for the factory that can be exported to other sites and markets. For this, we will create the most efficient and greenest production process. Italvolt is also collaborating with companies like Ramboll, IA engineering, Dentons Milano, and PwC for sustainable solutions in the areas of engineering, maintenance and operations, and advisory.

How does one plan financing when building a giga factory? When it comes to Italvolt, could you explain your investment strategy?

That is a valid question; one that you often get from local stakeholders: are you for real? or how can you show that you really can achieve this? It is a bit difficult if you come with empty pockets. To date, my investments have been to the tune of €3 million, because the initial phase is not very capital-intense as compared to the total CAPEX. Around €20 to €30 million would be needed to validate the project and attract larger investments. After the initial seed cap round, one looks towards governmental support. Direct support could come in as a part; then you have soft loans, eventual investments that could be up to a third of the total investment of €3.4 billion required. One-third is venture capital investment funds, and the next third is normal bank funding more or less. These are the three pillars: government, venture capital, and normal bank funding. What you need to do meanwhile, is to fulfill other requirements: you need to have the land, the technology, and you need offtakes. So actually, what you are achieving at this stage is making the venture and the company bankable. That is actually what you achieve during the initial process.

How would Italvolt help European countries in their zero-emission goals?

It will be difficult to find a secure supply in the next five years based on the European Economic and Social Committee (EESC) objectives and mandates. TUV SUD being a responsible battery producer will ensure compliance with all the EESC factors, this will enable us to deliver a green certificate to our end users. This is very crucial to our success. Another interesting aspect is that the EU will impose restrictions on battery import from Asia going forward. First, the long transportation would make a negative impact on the environment with these heavy products. Second, batteries from Asia may not adhere to Europe's zero-emission standards. Sure, we are lagging 10 years behind Asia, which has so far been ahead of us in battery manufacturing; but we will get there with the greenest batteries made in Europe. Also, this is a good way to bring the supply chain back to Europe and revive our economies. Many Asian companies are now starting to realize this is moving towards Europe and collaborating with companies like ours. It is a very interesting time in Europe from that perspective.

Could you share details of Italvolt's capacity and projected market demand by the time you reach full capacity in 2027?

We start in 2022 with constructing our giga plant, a massive building the size of 150 football fields! We plan our first battery delivery by the end of 2024. By 2027-28, we will be in full production capacity of around 45 GWh. Presently, we are more or less finalizing offtakes for about 25 to 30 percent of total capacity. We are now in a world where you can see, especially in the EV sector, an undersupply of 15 to 20 percent going forward. As long as you can come up with a valid technology, you can be quite sure to sell your batteries. More complicated is ensuring a green supply of materials, and manufacturing most sustainably; this is more challenging than the offtakes currently.

With an ecosystem created for e-mobility and battery business, many startups are looking to enter the renewable space; a couple of pointers for them as they consider venturing into these new sectors?

My firm view is that you first need to identify a space with low competition. Or you should have a very innovative technology that no one else has, then it is easy. From my perspective, you need to do it big; big scares people, they think it needs too much money because it is too big. Here we are talking €3.4 billion; it is a lot of money. You just need to disregard the huge sum; you need to switch off. You just need to see it as a normal business and not be affected by the massive amounts. Identify a space where competition is low, that is a first. I might love to build an EV for instance, it would be cool to do it, but I also realize a thousand other companies are doing just that. So, identify an impact area that is not mainstream. That is where you can create attention. Attention is very important; you should have a good peer front to start with. A very important part of this business is to get noticed.
