PowerCo secures land for Volkswagen’s next battery factory,2023-01-12,"Volkswagen’s plans for a battery cell factory in Spain have entered the next phase by purchasing a plot of land. PowerCo, the Group’s battery division, has signed the papers and was ready to invest €63 mn to buy 130 hectares in Sagunt, near Valencia.

PowerCo CEO Frank Blome announced the deal first on LinkedIn. The Spanish newspaper El Pais later found out how much the Volkswagen Group subsidiary had paid for the areal in Parc Sagunt II. Still, the €63 million spent on the land are just a tiny part of no less than ten billion euros Volkswagen has budgeted to invest along the entire e-mobility value chain in Spain.

Plans for the battery cell factory in Sagunt were confirmed in March 2022. PowerCo aims for 40 GWh capacity per year and plans to employ more than 3,000 people.

The PowerCo gigafactory, therefore, has been declared part of a Strategic Territorial Project (PTE) by the council of the Generalitat Valenciana. The Valencian President, Ximo Puig, pointed out that signing the agreement was an “essential step in the process initiated by the Volkswagen Group for its industrial plan and a milestone for the future of the economy of the Valencian Community”. The industrial estate Sagunt II is well connected to motorways, a port and a railway line.

As reported, PowerCo will begin construction this quarter, with production to kick off in 2026.

Sagunt will thus become the second “gigafactory” in the Volkswagen Group network, next to the identical battery plant in Salzgitter, Germany. The plant in Skellefteå will be overseen by Northvolt in Sweden. PowerCo has already mentioned focusing on Eastern Europe to install another factory but has yet to release information on the PowerCo battery factories five and six.

PowerCo and its latest partner Umicore reportedly aim to supply production materials for 160 gigawatt-hours of cell capacity per year starting in 2015. As Volkswagen calculates, this corresponds to an annual production capacity sufficient for around 2.2 million fully electric vehicles.

As for Spain, Volkswagen Group, primarily through its Spanish brand Seat, aims to make the country a major European production centre for electric vehicles and batteries. The battery plant in Sagunt will be flanked by vehicle plants in Martorell (near Barcelona) and Pamplona.

Martorell may make the small electric car Cupra Raval and another small VW electric car called ID.2 once confirmed. The two models shall replace the current Seat Ibiza and the VW Polo.

The Pamplona plant will build the VW ID.2 X crossover variant and the offshoot for Skoda, called Elroq. These new models correspond to the current VW T-Cross and Skoda Kamiq. The Group targets entry prices of all these small electric cars between 20,000 to 25,000 euros.

Around 60 companies associated with Volkswagen are participating in the Spanish projects. Volkswagen Group had also secured a considerable share of funding through the PERTE electric vehicle programme and received nearly 400 million euros in public aid.

In Sagunt, PowerCo will next open an office and has appointed Thomas Dahlem and Javier Rivera Jornet as members of the board of directors of Power HoldCo Spain, according to CEO Frank Blome. The new staff “will lead the Valencia gigafactory as a central project for transforming the Spanish automotive industry”.

Volkswagen established PowerCo to consolidate activities along the value chain for batteries, including processing raw materials, developing the unified Volkswagen battery, and managing the European gigafactories.

Gigafactory Valencia: PowerCo gives starting signal for construction of second cell factory,,"PowerCo SE is taking the next step in building its global battery business: In the Spanish region of Valencia, the company today gave the starting signal for construction of its second PowerCo cell factory in the presence of His Majesty King Felipe VI, Spain’s President Pedro Sánchez and Ximo Puig, President of the Valencian Generalitat. Gigafactory Valencia will start production of the unified cell in 2026 and will directly employ more than 3,000 people in the future, with a further up to 30,000 indirect jobs potentially being created at suppliers and partners in Spain according to a recent study. The Volkswagen Group has made battery technology a core element of its NEW AUTO strategy and has established PowerCo, a separate battery company. Since its launch in July 2022, PowerCo has decided three sites for cell factories: Salzgitter, Valencia and St. Thomas in Ontario/Canada, two of them already under construction.",https://www.volkswagen-newsroom.com/en/press-releases/gigafactory-valencia-powerco-gives-starting-signal-for-construction-of-second-cell-factory-15641
VW starts battery plant construction in Valencia and plans third party sales,2023-03-17,"Volkswagen has now officially given the go-ahead for the construction of the second battery cell factory of its subsidiary PowerCo in Valencia. Volkswagen is also said to be considering stakes in raw material mines and the sale of its battery cells to other customers.

First to Valencia: The key data of the gigafactory design there were already known before, and are now confirmed. Construction of the battery plant will start as planned in the first quarter of 2023, the annual production capacity for manufacturing the ‘unit cell’ is expected to be 40 gigawatt hours, the site will create more than 3,000 direct jobs and production will start in 2026. However, Volkswagen now, on the occasion of the start of construction, also mentions that the manufacturing facility could be expanded to 60 GWh and that up to 30,000 indirect jobs would be initiated with suppliers and partners in Spain.

The cell factory itself will be located in Sagunt – in the immediate vicinity of Valencia on an area of around 130 hectares. Together with the planned supplier park, which will be built parallel to the PowerCo factory, the area amounts to 200 hectares, according to Volkswagen. The Volkswagen subsidiary plans to supply the cell factory entirely with green electricity from the sun and wind. To this end, among other things, a 250-hectare solar park is being built near the plant. In addition, Volkswagen states that “in the long term” the raw material cycle will be closed directly on the site of the cell factory. This means that capacities for recycling and reprocessing will also be created on site.

Since its founding in July 2022, Volkswagen subsidiary PowerCo has identified three locations for cell factories: Salzgitter, Valencia and St. Thomas in Ontario, Canada. Two of these are already under construction, namely the one in Salzgitter and now also the one near Valencia. In the supply chain for electric car production, the Valencia plant is to close an important gap. In the future, it will “supply the vehicle plants in Martorell and Pamplona, among others, with unit cells,” according to the Wolfsburg-based company.

As is well known, the local cell production is part of a 10-billion-euro investment by Volkswagen, Seat and other partners in Spain, which in return is accompanied by a large government subsidy. Ergo, Spain’s Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez also came to the groundbreaking ceremony. “The factory that will be built here exemplifies the Spanish Government’s commitment to innovation and sustainable mobility. It is a sign of our commitment to industry, but also to the characteristics that define an entrepreneurial nation in the global market: innovation, territorial cohesion and public-private cooperation,” he is quoted as saying.

Meanwhile Thomas Schmall, Volkswagen Group board member for Group Technology and chairman of the supervisory board of PowerCo, commented that Volkswagen is planning to acquire stakes in raw material mines and to sell its battery cells to third parties. This is intended first and foremost to reduce costs. That fits with Volkswagen’s presentation of a 25,000-euro electric car to be sold in Europe starting in 2025, which gained global attention this week.

But Volkswagen’s plans for its PowerCo subsidiary go further. Schmall is quoted as saying that the goal is to cover half of the company’s own needs through in-house production and to sell to third-party customers in parallel. Ford has apparently been identified as a customer: PowerCo will begin supplying cells to Ford for the 1.2 million vehicles the US automaker is building in Europe on Volkswagen’s electric MEB platform, according to the Reuters report.

Schmall also expresses Volkswagen’s intention to invest directly in mines – but without giving further details. So far, the company has secured its supply of raw materials until 2026 and will decide in the coming months how to meet its needs from then on, the chief technology officer said. Volkswagen wants to “become a global battery supplier,” he said. And, “In the future, there will be a select number of battery standards. With our large volume and third-party sales, we want to be one of those standards.” Production is scheduled to start in Salzgitter in 2025, Valencia in 2026 and Ontario in 2027. Four more battery cell plants are to be built in Europe alone.

There is no official statement from Volkswagen itself on the latter facts. However, the communication on the laying of the foundation stone near Valencia contains passages that appear in a different light in light of Schmall’s interview statements: For example, the Wolfsburg company announces that PowerCo should generate annual sales of over 20 billion euros by 2030 – it is unlikely that this does not include the business model with third-party sales mentioned above.

Moreover, Schmall is also quoted in the official announcement as saying that “We are moving into the fast lane with PowerCo”. And: “Our objective is to make PowerCo a global player in the battery business and pave the way for better mobility with sustainably manufactured battery cells. The gigafactory Valencia is an important milestone in that.”

VW confirms plans for battery plant near Valencia,2022-03-23,"The Volkswagen Group has now officially confirmed the previously leaked plans to build a battery cell factory in Valencia, Spain. This is part of a total investment of more than seven billion euros along the entire e-mobility value chain in Spain.

In February, local media reported that the location for VW’s third battery cell factory after Skellefteå with Northvolt and Salzgitter had been decided: the factory was to be built in Sagunt north of Valencia – the industrial estate there is well connected to motorways, a port and a railway line.

“It’s our ambition to electrify Spain and we are willing to invest more than seven billion euro together with external suppliers for the electrification of our Martorell and Pamplona plants and the localization of the battery value chain in Valencia,” says Thomas Schmall, Member of the Board of Management for Technology at Volkswagen AG and Chairman of the Supervisory Board of Volkswagen subsidiary Seat.

The Valencia Gigafactory would be Volkswagen’s second cell factory location after Salzgitter – Skellefteå is to be operated by partner Northvolt. Volkswagen is aiming for a production capacity of 40 gigawatt-hours per year in Sagunt and plans to employ more than 3,000 people in Valencia.

Schmall announced plans to build “next-generation cell production” in Valencia. “A standardized factory, producing Volkswagen’s cutting-edge unified cell and supplied with renewable energy, enabling a sustainable battery production,” Schmall said. “It will create a strong pulling effect in the whole battery value chain in Spain and beyond.”

It is not clear from the VW statement which locations were in the running apart from Valencia. What was clear was that the third factory is to be built in southern Europe and, according to earlier announcements on electric car production, Spain was considered the favourite. VW only states that there were more than 100 criteria in the “demanding” selection process – such as skilled labour, public funding, good logistical connections and green energy. Whether the public-private cell factory near Barcelona announced in 2021 will now be built at all with VW and/or Seat participation is unlikely.

The timetable is tight even for Valencia: in order to be able to start series production in 2026, construction of the plant should begin by the end of the year. To this end, VW limits that all plans are still subject to final approvals, “in particular the outcome of the PERTE application”. Applications for the Spanish funding programme will be possible from 1 April.

VW’s fourth cell factory is to be built in Eastern Europe, exact countries or possible locations are not yet known. The locations of the planned factories 5 and 6 have not yet been determined. – However, the plant in Salzgitter, which is to start production in 2025, is to serve as a blueprint.

VW settles on location for Spanish battery plant,2022-02-24,"Volkswagen has decided on the location for the Volkswagen Group’s battery cell factory in Spain: it is to be built in Sagunt in the province of Valencia in eastern Spain and will have a capacity of 40 GWh per year.

VW had announced its intention to build a battery factory in Spain at the strategy presentation in July 2021 for 2030 called ‘New Auto’. With Sagunt, the exact location has now apparently been determined.

The decision for Sagunt is “95% made”, an official announcement could be made in the coming weeks. The project has a planned investment of around 3.5 billion euros and could create around 3,500 jobs. According to unnamed sources, VW will not announce its choice for Sagunt until the tender for the Spanish PERTE funding has been published. This is to be the case next week at the latest.

Through this funding program, Spain plans to invest a total of 4.3 billion euros by 2023 to boost the production of electric vehicles and batteries in the country. The program is to be financed mainly from the EU’s reconstruction fund. A further €19.7 billion in investment is to be made by the private sector by 2023, triggered by government funding.

The choice of Sagunt as the location comes as little surprise. VW, for example, is aiming to manufacture small electric cars at the Martorell plant, among others. Electric SUVs are to be built in Pamplona. At a press conference last December, however, Herbert Diess did not yet specify any concrete brands or models. He said that both locations were still “under review” and that a decision would also depend on funding commitments.

Volkswagen is also said to have chosen Sagunt because VW and Ford already reached an agreement in June 2020 for Ford electric vehicles based on the MEB platform. The battery plant in Sargunt could therefore supply not only the VW Group’s Spanish plants, but also the Ford plant in Almussafes on the outskirts of Valencia.

As is well known, Volkswagen is planning to build six gigafactories in Europe in order to meet the Group’s increasing cell demand. The Swedish company Northvolt is responsible for the first factory, which is to produce the unit cells for the premium segment. In 2025, a second cell production facility is to start in Salzgitter: The gigafactory in Lower Saxony will produce unit cells for the volume segment of the Volkswagen Group. The locations of battery factories 3 and 4 are to be determined in the first half of 2022; Spain and Eastern Europe have been under discussion here so far. However, Spain could now be the third battery factory, which would make it the fourth production site in Eastern Europe. Possible locations for factories 5 and 6, which are to be built by 2030, have not yet been named.

Volkswagen Group Announces €3 Billion Battery Gigafactory In Spain,,"The Volkswagen Group and SEAT announced that together with partners in the Future: Fast Forward project (total of 62 companies), it will invest €10 billion ($10.6 billion) to make Spain a European hub for electric mobility.

Part of the amount, which is described as the single largest industrial investment in Spain's history, is expected to come from the Strategic Project for Economic Recovery and Transformation program (PERTE), but the application must first be successfully accepted by the government.

Solar-powered battery gigafactory

One of the main parts of the entire project will be a new €3 billion ($3.2 billion) lithium-ion battery gigafactory in Sagunt near Valencia, which will supply battery cells to local EV plants (in Martorell and Pamplona).

The gigafactory in Spain (confirmed in 2021) will be Volkswagen's third after the one in Sweden (with Northvolt) and one in Germany. Three others will be announced at a later point.

Just like the other two, the plant in Sagunt will have a manufacturing capacity of 40 GWh/year. The construction is set to start in Q1 2023, while production is expected to start in 2026.

The Volkswagen Group intends to build a total of six 40 GWh battery gigafactories in Europe to secure up to 240 GWh of locally produced batteries by 2030.

According to Thomas Schmall, Member of the Board of Management of Volkswagen AG, Chief Technology Officer and Chairman of the Board of SEAT S.A., the PERTE funds will be essential for the investment:

The first milestone must be the positive outcome of the PERTE submission and the finalisation of the permits: “We will build the battery Gigafactory with an investment of more than 3 billion euros, but the PERTE funds are essential if we are to realise our ambition of turning Spain into a European hub for electric vehicles”,

The battery plant is promised to be powered by electricity from renewable sources. A major agreement with Iberdrola will result in a new photovoltaic plant (250 hectares), located less than 10 km (6 miles) from the battery factory. According to the press release, in the first phase, it will provide 20% of the gigafactory's total energy.

Volkswagen Group battery gigafactory in Spain:
