New Progress Made in Development of CALB’s Battery Manufacturing Base in Portugal,,"On November 2, 2022, Chinese battery supplier CALB signed a memorandum of cooperation with the Portuguese government. According to memorandum, CALB will build a major manufacturing base in Portugal as part of its expansion in Europe. Recently, new and concrete progress has been made in the implementation of this project.

CALB has reportedly initiated the process of obtaining an environmental permit for the planned base, which is set to be located in the Portuguese city of Sines. According to the reporting by foreign media, CALB submitted a proposal that defies the scope of the environmental impact of the project to the relevant regulatory agencies at the end of this February.

CALB said it aims to build a state-of-the-art manufacturing base in the local industrial park of Sines. The base will accommodate five plants that will be charge of producing Li-ion battery cells, producing electrodes, producing battery casings, and assembling batteries (battery packages). Spanning an area of 100 hectares, the base is set to have a production capacity of 15GWh per year.

Known as the “first gateway to Europe”, the port of Sines is a major logistics hub in the region. Its deep water port is the second largest in Europe and operates 24/7. The port is also the only one in Portugal that can receive some of the world’s largest cargo ships and is connected to the country’s largest freight railway platform. More than 5,000 container trains travel to and from the port every year, thus highlighting its critical geographical advantage.

The permit application that CALB has filed for the project reveals that the construction of the base is expected to take around 30 months, and the base is scheduled to enter operation by the end of 2025. CALB said the base will meet the huge and growing demand for EV power batteries from the European automotive industry.

Established in 2007, CALB offers Li-ion EV power batteries, battery management systems, energy storage solutions, and materials used in Li-ion batteries. The company is able to engage in technological R&D, battery manufacturing, sales, and application development. On October 6, 2022, the company was formally listed on the Main Board of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and thus obtained access to international capital.

Regarding CALB’s overseas ventures, the company has recently entered into a supply agreement with Forsee, a well-known French brand for smart battery systems. Together, they will be providing Li-ion batteries that power buses, trucks, specialty vehicles, and even ships worldwide. Also, in July 2022, CALB reached a strategic cooperation agreement with BMZ Group that also specializes in technologies related to Li-ion batteries. Through BMZ, CALB will be able to introduce its innovative solutions to buses, trucks, agricultural machinery, construction machinery, and other kinds of commercial power systems. In sum, projects and deals such those mentioned above are enabling CALB to accelerate its global expansion.

CALB signs MoU for factory in Portugal,2022-11-04 00:00:00,"The Chinese battery manufacturer CALB wants to build its first European factory in Portugal, specifically at the port of Sines. The company has signed a non-binding letter of intent with a subsidiary of the Portuguese Agency for Investment and Foreign Trade (AICEP).

The news portal Euractiv has learned some key points of the plans from Nuno Gameiro, the CALB manager responsible for Portugal. According to the agreement, the first phase of the battery cell factory, which will have an annual capacity of 15 GWh, is to go into operation at the end of 2025. The aim is for CALB batteries to be installed in several European cars from the end of the first quarter of 2026. A tripling of production to 45 GWh is then planned by 2028. And: A possible third expansion phase is already being considered.

CALB (China Lithium Battery Technology) announced that it wanted to build a factory in Europe at the beginning of this year and had concluded a strategic agreement for the construction with Drees & Sommer, a consultancy firm for the construction and real estate sector with headquarters in Germany. At that time, there were indications that CALB was flirting with the idea of building in Germany as an “industrial base”. Now, however, Portugal is apparently coming out ahead of Germany.

CALB currently has seven production sites in Changzhou, Luoyang, Xiamen, Chengdu, Wuhan, Hefei and Heilongjiang with a planned capacity of 200 GWh for 2022. A year ago, CALB announced the expansion of its production capacities to initially 300 GWh by 2025 and later increased this target to 500 GWh by 2025 and 1,000 GWh by 2030.

According to an analysis by market research firm SNE Research, the group accounted for 4.1 per cent of the global electric vehicle battery market in the first half of 2022. With 8.4 GWh, CALB was the seventh largest supplier worldwide, according to the statistics.

Meanwhile, the group also completed its Hong Kong IPO in October, announced earlier this year. The IPO raised 10.1 billion Hong Kong dollars (about 1.33 billion euros) for CALB and was the largest IPO in Hong Kong so far this year.

CALB starts process for lithium battery unit in Sines,2023-03-24 09:05:26+00:00,"The Chinese manufacturer’s proposal defines that CALB’s future lithium battery factory for electric cars will be located in the Sines Industrial and Logistics Zone.

The manufacturer China Aviation Lithium Battery Technology (CALB) has already started the environmental licensing process of the construction project of the Lithium Battery Unit, in Sines, in the district of Setúbal, for electric vehicles.

At the end of February, CALB presented to the Portuguese Environment Agency (APA) a Proposal for Definition of Scope (PDA) of the Environmental Impact Study (EIA), whose public consultation runs until 20 of this month, on the Participa portal, for the installation of the lithium battery industrial unit in Sines.

According to the APA, the phase of defining the scope of the EIA, which is prior to the evaluation process and is optional, “aims to identify, analyze and select the significant environmental aspects that may be affected by the project and on which the EIA should focus”.

The proposal, consulted by the Lusa agency, defines that CALB’s future lithium battery factory for electric cars will be located in the Industrial and Logistics Zone of Sines (ZILS), managed by aicep Global Parques.

“The project aims at the construction and operation of a lithium battery production unit, on land that is part of the Industrial and Logistics Zone of Sines (ZILS)”, in an area of 100 hectares, read in the document.

The land “identified for the lithium battery factory has about 100 hectares”, and the installation of the production unit is “expected”, which will have “a capacity of 15 Gwh [Gigawatts]”, in an area “of about 50 hectares”.

The factory will be built “using technology aimed at protecting the environment and complying with applicable environmental legislation, also with a view to building a low-carbon industrial unit,” he says.

The industrial unit will have “a ‘Leed/Bream’ type certification”, using “renewable energy sources”, “water reuse” and “waste recycling”.

In a statement to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in November 2022, CALB revealed that it had signed a memorandum of understanding with a subsidiary of the Agency for Investment and Foreign Trade of Portugal (AICEP).

The agreement with aicep Global Parques included the acquisition of “surface rights, with the aim of setting up a world-class, highly intelligent, computerized and automated factory, with zero carbon emissions,” the company said.

CALB “has not yet signed a legally binding agreement”, so “the cooperation contemplated in the memorandum of understanding may or may not move forward,” he stressed.

In the memorandum of understanding, signed in November, in Sines, with aicep Global Parques, manager of ZILS, CALB demonstrated that this municipality on the Alentejo coast was “one of the privileged locations,” said, at the time, the mayor of Sines, Nuno Mascarenhas, in statements to the Lusa agency.

“Sines is one of the privileged locations for CALB, since we have all the conditions here, but it is only the first intention,” said the mayor at the time.

According to the China Automotive Power Battery Industry Innovation Alliance, an industrial association, CALB was in 2021 the third largest Chinese manufacturer of electric car batteries.",https://scantech.com/news/process-for-lithium-battery-unit-in-sines/
CALB starts manufacturing batteries at new Hefei plant,2022-10-10 00:00:00,"Chinese battery manufacturer CALB (China Lithium Battery Technology) has started production at its new 50 GWh factory in Hefei and said it will increase capacity there to 150 GWh. CALB is also now listed on the Hong Kong stock exchange.

The new factory was first announced in the plant in Hefei in September 2021 where NCM cells for the automotive industry are to be produced. The new battery type is code-named L221, and is a mid-nickel high-pressure NCM battery that targets long ranges for electric cars of over 600km. The battery adopts the all-tab laminated battery technology, which CALB says features high volumetric energy density and fast charging performance.

The commissioning of the CALB factory in Hefei is only the first phase of three. A second phase and a third phase, each expanding capacity by 50GWh will follow, the second phase is to be finished this year, while the third phase will follow an agreement with the local authority of Changfeng county.

CALB currently has seven production sites in Changzhou, Luoyang, Xiamen, Chengdu, Wuhan, Hefei and Heilongjiang with a planned capacity of 200 GWh for 2022. A year ago, CALB announced the expansion of its production capacity to an initial 300 GWh by 2025 and later increased this target to 500 GWh by 2025 and 1,000 GWh by 2030. CALB is also planning a factory in Europe.

According to an analysis by market research firm SNE Research, CALB accounted for 4.1 per cent of the global electric vehicle battery market in the first half of 2022. With 8.4 GWh, the Chinese company were the seventh largest supplier worldwide, according to the statistics.

CALB reveals high-density battery with 25-year lifecycle,2023-10-04 00:00:00,"Dr. Zheng Xiang , Vice President of CALB Europe explains, “By leveraging our world-class R&D capabilities and supply chain, CALB is ready to meet the sustainable development of global enterprise and industrial customers with our comprehensive suite of energy storage products.”

Founded in 2015, CALB is now listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. The company has rapidly gained a position among China’s top battery makers with robust supply chains, R&D and production operations across Jiangsu, Fujian, Sichuan, Hubei, Anhui, and Guangdong provinces.

CALB has designed the 314Ah to be scalable, highlighting the fact that the product can be customized for the specific requirements of diverse commercial applications. The battery maker also offers air- and liquid-cooled battery solutions with capacities of up to 6.58 MWh, as well as small-scale commercial products of up to 425 kWh. Just when suppliers and the shipping industry are having to deal with increased emissions reporting, CALB is offering battery products for maritime applications featuring increased weight reduction and up to 10,000 charge cycles.

The battery maker says its upgraded CALB 314Ah Cell now contains lithium replenishment technology that extends its lifespan to 15,000 charge cycles, noting that this is equivalent to a 25-year lifecycle. CALB guarantees that the upgraded battery solution has zero degradation in the first 1,000 charging cycles. The Chinese energy storage solution specialist says the CALB 314Ah has been put through extensive optimisations that have increased its usable energy by 12 per cent with a round-trip efficiency that reaches 96 per cent.

With its recent globalisation drive, the company is pushing forward with its production facility in Portugal, announced in 2022. This European focus, as well as revealing its new battery solution in the USA, marks a new phase of international collaboration with its globalisation push. Earlier this year, the battery cell supplier signed agreements with French company Forsee Power, which assembles purchased cells into battery systems for use in electric buses and other electric commercial vehicles, but also for maritime applications.

A year earlier, CALB signed a strategic cooperation agreement with the German BMZ Group to develop and produce lithium-ion batteries for use in electric commercial vehicles for markets in Europe, America and Asia-Pacific. But this is not the only German connection for the Chinese battery maker.

Having increased its focus on the electric car market since 2019, CALB’s automotive customers include GAC Aion, Changan Auto, Geely Automobile. This year, the Chinese battery maker signed supply agreements with Nio for its new sub-brand. CALB’s collaboration with automotive technology leader Xpeng goes back to early on between the two relatively young companies. Now CALB is the electric car manufacturer’s largest battery supplier. Volkswagen’s recent cooperation with Xpeng could also spell good news for CALB’s globalisation strategy in Europe.

Earlier this month, Reuters reported that CALB aims to source 70% of materials it needs in Europe by 2026. Wu Tao, general manager of CALB’s marketing division, told the news agency, “We do feel it’s necessary to localise supplies of materials as much as possible.” He explained that this was being advanced by offering technical support to local firms as well as encouraging Chinese suppliers to establish plants in Europe.

In Las Vegas this month, Dr. Zheng Xiang noted, “Our appearance at RE+ signifies our commitment to helping the global markets reach their carbon reduction and carbon neutrality targets.” The company is confident it will further accelerate its globalisation strategy with the strength of its 314Ah energy storage solution and the progress of its plans for European production.
