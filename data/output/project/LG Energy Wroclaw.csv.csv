LG Energy Solution and Impact Clean Power Technology Sign Multi-year Battery Supply Agreement to Power Electric Buses in Europe - 배터리인사이드,2023-12-07 04:00:03+00:00,"SEOUL, December 7, 2023 – LG Energy Solution (KRX: 373220), a leading global manufacturer of advanced lithium-ion batteries, and Impact Clean Power Technology(ICPT), a top global supplier of heavy-duty battery systems for public transportation, announced that they have signed a supply agreement for NCM lithium-ion battery modules.

Over the next three years, LG Energy Solution will deliver around 200,000 units of battery modules manufactured at its Wroclaw plant in Poland to ICPT’s GigafactoryX in Pruszkow, where they will be assembled into battery packs and systems. The supplied batteries will be capable of supporting the manufacture of nearly 3,000 large commercial electric vehicles.

With the entire process from battery manufacturing to electric bus production taking place in Poland, this deal aims to establish a comprehensive supply chain for Europe’s electric public transportation system. The partnership also signifies the concerted efforts of both companies to drive forward the electrification of Europe.

The agreement also marks a major milestone for both companies in solidifying technological leadership in the highly demanding commercial vehicle sector. Batteries for commercial vehicles like electric buses must withstand a much higher energy flow, up to around 11 times higher than passenger cars, which is why LG Energy Solution will apply NCM chemistry to its batteries to enhance their durability and driving range.

“Our partnership with ICPT, a highly trusted battery systems provider for public transportation, presents us an exciting opportunity to introduce our outstanding battery technology to the fast-growing European commercial vehicle market,” said Seungtaek Hong, head of Advanced Automotive Battery OTS Marketing Department at LG Energy Solution. “Capitalizing on our Wroclaw plant, which is the biggest battery manufacturing facility in Europe, we are committed to establishing a robust supply chain in Europe and expediting its transition to sustainable mobility.”

LG Energy Solution Wroclaw is Europe’s largest producer of lithium-ion batteries for the automotive industry. Located in Biskupice Podgorne (Kobierzyce commune), the plant’s current capacity is 70GWh and covers an area of about 100 hectares. All battery components are manufactured up to the point where they are ready for installation in a car. LG Energy Solution Wroclaw makes Poland the European leader in the industry.

“Our partnership with LG Energy Solution will strengthen our leading battery offering in the bus market. Together, we can provide our customers with exceptional, advanced solutions tailored to the demanding conditions of this market,” said Bartek Kras, Vice President of ICPT. “Considering the strong global demand, this is a significant added value for this sector. This way, we can offer both our current and new customers the highest quality and guaranteed supply assurance.”",https://inside.lgensol.com/en/2023/12/lg-energy-solution-and-impact-clean-power-technology-sign-multi-year-battery-supply-agreement-to-power-electric-buses-in-europe/

(Infographics #2) 2025 Global Production Target of LG Energy Solution,2023-05-19 02:00:18+00:00,"How many EVs can be produced with 540 GWh?

LG Energy Solution aims to improve its annual battery production capacity up to 540 GWh through its global strategies that include expanding production facilities. (*EV batteries, small batteries and ESS are included.) GWh is commonly used when measuring energy consumption of large power plant or a nation. 1 GWh is equivalent to 1,000,000 kWh. Since manufacturing a high-performance EV requires 80 kWh, 540 GWh is large enough to manufacture 6.75 million EVs.

LG Energy Solution announced mid-to long-term business strategies in its earnings presentation for the second quarter of 2022. For the North American market, it plans to expand joint ventures with finished car manufacturers and to supply more cylindrical batteries for its existing clients and EV startups. In Europe, it will increase supply by establishing a new production base for cylindrical batteries in addition to the Poland plant where pouch batteries are produced. In addition, for the Asian market, the battery maker will build a new production base beside China.

LG Energy Solution expects it can build a balanced production capacity across the globe with such strategies. You can look forward to watching it realize mid-to long-term goals and re-establish its status as the leader in the battery industry.",https://inside.lgensol.com/en/2023/05/infographics-2-2025-global-production-target-of-lg-energy-solution/

In particular, it is crucial to guarantee that customers’ expectations of quality are met, as this relates directly to their confidence in the company. The PACK 1 team and the technical team work together to mitigate any potential risks during production to ensure battery quality. The goal is to anticipate problems on the production line and reduce potential quality issues.

It is the responsibility of the PACK 1 production manager to keep these tasks under control. From my office, I can see all of PACK 1’s production lines.

"LG Energy Solution Wins E-mobility Leader Award for Efforts in Zero-emission Mobility, Largest Single EV Battery Manufacturing Facility in Europe Running on 100% Renewable Energy",2022-05-05 16:21:58+00:00,"LG Energy Solution wins e-mobility leader award for efforts in zero-emission mobility, largest single EV battery manufacturing facility in Europe running on 100% renewable energy.

LG Energy Solution (LGES; KRX: 373220) announced that its manufacturing facility in Wroclaw, Poland, has won the Electromobility (E-Mobility) Leader 2021 Award for its contributions to zero-emission mobility in Poland.

LG Energy Solution Wroclaw is the largest single EV battery manufacturer in Europe, currently with 70GWh production capacity which is expected to reach 115GWh by 2025.

Recently, Mayor Drew Dilkens of Windsor, Canada, visited the facility to learn about battery manufacturing process, as well as its mission towards carbon neutrality, taking into account the new LGES-Stellantis JV plant being constructed in Windsor.

In fact, LGES Wroclaw’s plant has already completed 100% transition to renewable energy (RE100) in 2019 through Green Pricing Scheme and purchase of Renewable Energy Certificate.

Sukwon Choi, President of LG Energy Solution Wroclaw, said:

LG Energy Solution Wroclaw is trying to create a new dimension of the global automotive market. We see not only the growing demand for batteries, but also how important it is to take action on climate change, and we are pleased that our activities are being recognized and appreciated.

Now in place for four consecutive years, E-Mobility Leader Award is hosted by the Polish Alternative Fuels Association (PSPA), a non-governmental organization composed of over 120 companies from the entire e-mobility value chain, along with industry experts and institutions.

This year, four winners were selected through analyzing candidates’ responses to the survey questionnaire prepared by PwC, as well as assessing their investment in research and plans for further development of zero-emission transport.

ESWA’s win is yet another representation of LGES’s proactive response to climate change. So far, all of its global business sites have joined RE100 (Renewable Electricity 100%) – a global initiative committed to using 100% renewable energy by 2050.

LGES aims to beat the deadline by 20 years and transition all businesses to 100% renewable energy by 2030. Manufacturing facilities in Wroclaw (Poland) and Michigan (U.S.) have already achieved RE100 in 2019 and 2020, respectively, and two LGES plants in Nanjing (China) are also expected to do so within this year.

Based on this series of accomplishments, LGES was recently designated as a member of Advisory Committee of RE100 Board of Directors.

In addition to transitioning to renewable energy, LGES is also putting efforts in reusing and recycling batteries.

It is not only developing technologies for battery reuse in ESS (Energy Storage System), but also building a closed-loop system that enables extracting and recycling of raw materials from used batteries.

LG Energy Solution in a statement, said:

Our mission toward RE100 is becoming more important as we expand our investment in renewable energy, and more customers and investors asking us to take actions against climate change.

“Batteries are central products in the carbon-neutral society, and accordingly, LGES will continue to establish exemplary practices in reducing greenhouse gas (GHG),” added the company spokesperson.
