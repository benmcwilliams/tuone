Northvolt starts delivering cells from Skellefteå factory,2022-05-18 00:00:00,"Northvolt has started commercial deliveries of battery cells to a car manufacturer. It makes the Swedish start-up the first European firm that has managed to do so. And, they have made the shipments from the Ett factory in Skellefteå, Sweden, on schedule.

Production has only been running for a few months. Northvolt’s first battery cell factory in Sweden that is now delivering made the first cell in December as reported. Already then, the company was confident, naming the date as “a new chapter in European industrial history” as it would be the first battery cell “designed, developed and assembled entirely in a Gigafactory by a domestic European battery company”. Having managed that, production is expected to increase further this year.

The Northvolt Ett factory currently employs about 1,000 people, a company spokesperson told Bloomberg, prompting the news agency to add that Northvolt continues hiring about 150 new employees each month. The company expects the number of employees in North Sweden to rise to around 4,000 in the long term, up from an earlier estimate of 3,000.

The report made no mention of who Northvolt supplied with the first cells. However, their push answers a dire need across the European car industry. The company, founded by ex-Tesla VP for Supply chain, Peter Carlsson, has signed contracts with carmakers worth more than $50 billion so far, and Bloomberg suggests this may help the newcomers survive skyrocketing prices for raw materials. Among Northvolt’s customers are BMW, Volkswagen, Volvo Cars and Polestar. The cooperation with Volkswagen will for example see the factory in Skellefteå deliver the new “standard” cells to the Group. Previous plans to run a factory in Salzgitter together have been scrapped.

In addition, Northvolt recently received a grant of 155 million for its planned battery plant in Germany. Northvolt Three will be built in the town of Heide, close to the border of Denmark, and is to go into operation in 2025, employing up to 3,000 people. According to Northvolt, the envisioned 60 GWh capacity will be enough for around one million electric vehicles. The Northvolt Drei plant increases Northvolt’s total production capacity to 170 GWh.

The company also announced another cell factory in Sweden, not far from Volvo’s Torslanda plant, in partnership with Volvo Cars this April. This will be Northvolt’s third battery factory in Sweden. The company is refurbishing an old paper mill in Borlänge into a gigafactory to produce up to 100 GWh of cathode material as well as battery cells.

A few days ago, Hydrovolt, Northvolt’s joint venture with Norsk Hydro, also commissioned its battery recycling plant in Fredrikstad, Norway.

North Swedish battery gigafactory expands before production start,,"The gigafactory outside Skellefteå in northern Sweden has not yet started production before funding to a 50% expansion of capacity is on the table. Northvolt, branding its factory to produce World’s greenest battery, will start output later this year, with customers like VW, BMW, and Scania hungry to buy whatever the production lines can provide.

Between 2019 and 2027, the size of the global market for electric vehicles (EV) is expected to boom almost five-fold. This year, more than 4 million battery-powered cars will be sold, with an accumulated number by 2027 believed to reach more than 230 million units.

Limited production of batteries is one factor that could be limiting the size of the market.

As recently reported by the Barents Observer, northern Sweden takes a lead position in the new industrial revolution, shifting to technologies aimed to slow climate change. The regions of Västerbotten and Norrbotten alone are expected to get 10,000 new workplaces with carbon-free production of steel, mining of metals, and battery production.

Northvolt’s factory in Skellefteå alone will count for 6,000 employees. All production will be based on renewable energy like hydropower, windmills and solar.

The $2,75 billion raised in new equity comes from the Swedish pension funds, OMERS Capital Market alongside existing investors in Northvolt like Goldman Sachs and VW Group, the company says in a press statement.

VW is one of Northvolt’s main customers and has already ordered batteries for $14 billion to supply the group’s wide range of electric vehicles from Audi, Skoda, Seat, Porsche and VW.

Making the world’s cleanest batteries in Quebec,2023-09-28 00:00:00,"All along the electric vehicle supply chain, from mining to processing critical minerals, through building batteries, Quebec is attracting historic investments from companies all around the world. These investments are growing the economy and creating well-paying middle-class jobs for today and for decades to come.

The Prime Minister of Canada, Justin Trudeau, was joined today by the Premier of Quebec, François Legault, to welcome a new electric vehicle battery manufacturing facility to be built by Northvolt Batteries North America in Saint-Basile-le-Grand and McMasterville, Quebec. Powered by clean electricity, the batteries produced will be among the greenest batteries in the world. Once fully operational, the plant will generate economic benefits equal to the value of the production incentives provided, within five to nine years. This plant will support tens of thousands of jobs across the country and contribute up to $1.6 billion to GDP annually when it is at full capacity.

Occupying an area equivalent to 318 football fields, the Northvolt project will have an annual battery cell manufacturing capacity of up to 60 GWh, which is enough to power approximately one million electric vehicles per year. The first 30-GWh phase of the project, valued at $7 billion in total investment, will create up to 3,000 jobs in the region as the plant reaches its full production potential. This first phase will also include adjacent facilities for cathode active material production and battery recycling. This will make it the only fully integrated facility of this type in Canada, and one of the only ones in the world.

These types of investments in our electric vehicle supply chain are a historic vote of confidence in Quebec from global automakers. They continue to put Quebec, and Canada, at the forefront of electric vehicle manufacturing, as we work to build a strong, competitive economy, create good middle-class jobs now and into the future, and fight climate change.

Quick Facts

Today’s announcement builds on important agreements that Canada has signed over the last year to bring billions in investments and a large number of new, high-quality jobs to our critical minerals and electric vehicle manufacturing sectors. This follows important investments already made in the Canada and Quebec battery supply chain with Volta Energy Solutions Canada, EcoPro CAM Canada and GM-POSCO.

Canada and Quebec have committed to providing Northvolt with production support to match the Inflation Reduction Act’s Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit in the United States, equalling up to US$35 per kWh.

Government production incentives will apply only to the batteries that Northvolt produces and sells, in line with the conditions in previous agreements with other battery plants. They will be up to C$4.6 billion, of which one third is to be paid by the Quebec government.

The operating support provided will only be available for as long as the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act incentives remain in effect.

Canada will provide up to C$1.34 billion in capital commitment toward the project.

Quebec will provide C$1.37 billion in capital commitment toward the project.

Northvolt’s facility will focus on sustainability and will produce a variety of battery components and materials, such as precursor cathode active materials (pCAM), cathode active materials (CAM), lithium-ion battery cells, and lithium-nickel-manganese-cobalt-oxide (NMC) from battery recycling, one of only a handful of locations to have this type of capacity outside of Asia.

By 2030, Northvolt’s unique decarbonization strategy aims to reduce the carbon footprint of its cell manufacturing by approximately 90% compared to the current industry average. The company also intends to use at least 50% recycled materials in its cell production. By recovering quality metals from used batteries, Northvolt will help to ensure that Canadian critical raw materials remain in circulation.

Canada’s automotive manufacturing sector supports over 500,000 workers, contributes $14 billion annually to Canada’s GDP, and is one of the country’s largest export industries.

In December 2022, the Government of Canada released the Canadian Critical Minerals Strategy to help advance the development of critical mineral resources and value chains across the country. This strategy will advance our efforts to make Canada a global leader in the responsible, inclusive, and sustainable production of critical minerals, from exploration to recycling.

Article by North Sweden Business

SKELLEFTEÅ Battery manufacturer Northvolt announced on Thursday that it will build a battery factory outside Montreal, Quebec, Canada.

The new plant outside Montreal, named Northvolt Six, will produce batteries, cathode materials and recycle batteries.

The factory will produce batteries with a total capacity of 60 GWh, which is four times more than the first phase in the factory in Skellefteå, Sweden. Construction will start at the end of 2023 and production will start in 2026 at an estimated cost of USD 5 billion. According to the company, this is the largest ever private investment in Quebec. The factory is expected to employ 3,000 people.

“In the seven years since Northvolt was founded, we have pursued a singular goal — to establish a new, sustainable model for battery manufacturing. Today, we are expanding our ambitions by bringing Northvolt to Canada”, says Peter Carlsson, CEO and Co-Founder of Northvolt.

Northvolt Co-Founder Paolo Cerruti will lead the project as CEO of Northvolt North America, which will have its head office in Montréal.

“We have in Northvolt Six enormous potential, not only to rapidly expand our ability to bring sustainable batteries into markets of North America, but to accelerate Quebec’s emergence as a key actor in the global energy transition. With its unique access to renewable power and raw materials, we see this as the ideal base of operations for Northvolt’s first gigafactory outside of Europe”, says Paolo Cerruti.

The prerequisite for the establishment is that Canada has introduced investment support to match the US support package.

Northvolt’s first factory in Skellefteå in northern Sweden is in production now and will increase capacity in the coming years. Two more factories are planned in Sweden, in Gothenburg and Borlänge, and a factory in Germany.",https://www.arctictoday.com/%F0%9F%87%B8%F0%9F%87%AA-%F0%9F%87%A8%F0%9F%87%A6-northvolt-to-establish-battery-factory-in-quebec/

Swedish battery maker Northvolt will build a $5 billion lithium-ion battery factory in Québec, Canada, the company announced Thursday.

The factory, the company's first outside of Europe, marks the largest private investment in the Canadian province's history. It's set to include 60 gigawatt hours of battery production capacity, with adjacent facilities for cathode active material manufacturing and battery recycling.

Construction on the project is slated to begin by the end of the year and operations are expected to start in 2026. Northvolt will employ up to 3,000 people at the site.

The battery maker said it chose the 170-hectare site near Montreal after an ""extensive review"" of North American locations. The company will also house its North American headquarters in Montreal, which will be led by co-founder Paolo Cerruti.

""In the seven years since Northvolt was founded, we have pursued a singular goal – to establish a new, sustainable model for battery manufacturing,"" CEO and co-founder Peter Carlsson said in a statement. ""Today, we are expanding our ambitions by bringing Northvolt to Canada.”

Founded in Stockholm in 2016, Northvolt currently delivers batteries from its factory in Skellefteå, Sweden and from its R&D and industrialization campus in Västerås, Sweden. The company employs more than 5,000 people across Sweden, Germany, Norway, Poland, Portugal, the U.S. and Canada.

Like many manufacturers, Northvolt was influenced by the Inflation Reduction Act. The law provides tax credits for electric vehicles with at least 50% of their components manufactured in North America.

""It definitely played a role to accelerate our decision to expand into North America,"" Cerutti told CNBC.",https://www.manufacturingdive.com/news/northvolt-battery-factory-lithium-ion-canada-quebec-montreal-inflation-reduction-act/695171/
Canada is pouring billions of dollars into the electric vehicle industry. Will it pay off?,,"Standing before a backdrop that declared Quebec's commitment to a clean economy, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Premier François Legault outlined the details of what they both described as a ""historic"" project.

The numbers are eye popping. A new manufacturing facility to be built by Northvolt, a Swedish battery giant, will occupy 170 hectares — an area the size of more than 300 football fields — on Montreal's South Shore, in a parcel of land spanning two communities.

Eventually, it is projected to have an annual battery cell manufacturing capacity of up to 60 gigawatt-hours (GWh), which is enough to power roughly one million electric vehicles a year.

This first phase, set to be complete by the end of 2026, will also include facilities to produce cathode active materials (a component of the batteries used in electric vehicles) and recycle batteries.

The government says the project will create as many as 3,000 jobs.

WATCH | Breaking down the case for and against EV financing:

Quebec, Canada bet billions on an EV battery plant east of Montreal Duration 2:07 Northvolt, a Swedish battery manufacturing giant, says it will build a new multibillion-dollar electric vehicle battery plant east of Montreal. Quebec leaders are calling it the largest private investment in the province's history — along with billions in public funding — but others say it carries no guarantees it will pay off for taxpayers.

It comes at a high cost: The federal and provincial governments are putting a combined $2.7 billion in taxpayer money toward the project.

There will also be government production incentives totalling up to $4.6 billion — one-third of which will come from Quebec — as long as similar incentives remain in place in the U.S.

'We paid a big price'

The deal is the latest in a series of announcements supporting the burgeoning electric vehicle industry in Canada.

Such projects have faced questions, given the amount of public money involved, but experts say public financing is crucial to compete against cut-throat international competition.

Last month, Ottawa and Quebec announced an investment of more than $640 million for a new Ford EV plant in Bécancour, Que .

The federal government has also committed billions in Ontario to save the Stellantis-LG electric vehicle battery plant in Windsor and subsidize the Volkswagen battery plant in St. Thomas.

It will take 20 years for the federal and Ontario governments to break even on the pledge to give $28 billion in production subsidies for those two plants, the Parliamentary Budget Officer concluded .

The auto industry has a long history of being propped up by the government, said Greig Mordue, the chair of advanced manufacturing policy at McMaster University's school of engineering, and a former Toyota executive.

""We'll see where this shakes out, but we paid a big price,"" Mordue said of this week's Quebec announcement.

""Our industrial policy now consists of one tool and that is a chequebook, and that's where we are today.""

Levelling the playing field

Trudeau and Legault pushed back on that idea. During Thursday's news conference, Legault likened the investment to the billions spent on hydro-electric dams in northern Quebec 50 years ago under premier Robert Bourrassa.

People called Bourrassa crazy, too, he said.

""For the next 50 years, what's going to be important is the green economy,"" said Legault.

""So we're building on what Bourassa and company did in Quebec.""

Paolo Cerruti, the CEO and co-founder of Northvolt, said the company was drawn to the cheap, clean hydro power on offer and the raw materials that could soon be available. A lithium mine is ramping up production in La Corne, Que., 550 kilometres north of Montreal.

The financial incentives played a big role, too.

""Canada put itself on a level playing field with what the United States has been doing,"" he said.

The Inflation Reduction Act , viewed as the most ambitious climate action bill in U.S. history, was also an international ""game changer,"" spurring competition between countries to be part of the growing green economy, said Meena Bibra, a senior policy analyst at Clean Energy Canada, a think tank based at Simon Fraser University.

""We're at a point where we either remain competitive in this race to electrification or we get left behind,"" she said. ""The rest of the world, the EU and the U.S. and other economies like China, are moving forward with strong industrial policy on electric vehicles.""

A 2022 report from Clean Energy Canada estimated the country has the potential to build a domestic EV battery supply chain that could support up to 250,000 jobs by 2030 and add $48 billion to the economy annually.

'Biggest transition in 100 years'

Globally, a surge in demand for electric vehicles is already underway.

Since 2021, there has been a 240 per cent increase in electric car sales around the world, according to a report this week from the International Energy Agency that highlighted a sharp increase in clean energy.

A total of 14 per cent of all new cars sold in 2022 were electric, up from around nine per cent in 2021 and less than five per cent in 2020, according to the IEA.

Dozens of battery plants are already planned in the U.S. By 2030, North America's manufacturing capacity for electric vehicle batteries is projected to be 20 times greater than a decade prior.

""This is the biggest transition in 100 years,"" said Maria Kelleher, a Toronto-based consultant who specializes in clean energy projects.

""We are at a very pivotal point in history and the history of the auto sector, and you just have to put your hand deep in your pocket and take out a big whack of cash to get the thing off the ground.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/climate/canada-quebec-ev-battery-1.6982613
