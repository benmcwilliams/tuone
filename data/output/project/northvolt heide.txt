Article 1: {'title': 'Germany: Northvolt makes progress on cell plant in Heide', 'published_date': '2023-05-12 00:00:00', 'keywords': [], 'text': 'Swedish battery cell manufacturer Northvolt is making progress in setting up a factory in Germany. The communities of Lohe-Rickelshof and Norderwöhrden have agreed to enter the next phase of the approval process. In addition, Northvolt is seeking what is known as TCTF funding.\n\nThis is according to a joint announcement by the German Federal Ministry of Economy, the Schleswig-Holstein state government and Northvolt. Specifically, the above-mentioned municipalities decided to initiate the next phase of the approval process, described in the communication as “an important milestone on the way to the future start of construction”. Other steps planned for 2023 are preparing the ground for the construction of the factory and obtaining the final building permit.\n\nLohe-Rickelshof and Norderwöhrden are located near Heide, a town of 20,000 people in northern Germany that will be the official address of the Northvolt factory. The first batteries are expected to leave the plant in 2026. Once the factory is fully ramped up, the annual production capacity will be 60 GWh – enough to supply around one million electric vehicles with battery cells made in Germany.\n\nIn addition to the existing IPCEI funding, all parties involved – i.e. Northvolt and public representatives at various levels – are applying for funding based on the new Temporary Crisis and Transition Framework (TCTF), which the EU Commission must then approve. According to the statement, the German government and the EU Commission have already begun constructive talks. If the EU Commission approves the grant, it will be the first project in Germany to receive TCTF funding. It would unleash billions in private investment and create 3,000 jobs in Heide and thousands more in the industry and service sector.\n\n“With the new TCTF, the EU-Commission opened up a clear path towards securing important industrial investments in Europe in key green technologies”, says German Economics Minister Robert Habeck. “We have been in negotiations with Northvolt since almost one year. Our trustful dialogue with the company and all relevant stakeholders has proven successful, and important next steps towards realization of the project therefore can now be taken.”\n\nPeter Carlsson, founder and CEO of Northvolt, says: “We’re grateful for all the efforts being made by the Federal Government, the state government of Schleswig-Holstein, the EU-Commission but also made on local level in the district of Dithmarschen. Backed by this commitment of the federal government, Northvolt has decided to take the next steps towards our expansion in Heide.”\n\nNorthvolt initially announced in March 2022 that it planned to start production at the Heide factory in Schleswig-Holstein in 2025. Then in October, the company warned of a possible delay. Now, the plant will be ready in 2026.\n\nHowever, it is now also clear that Northvolt does not want to put its plans for a German factory on hold because of US subsidies. A spokesman for the company told Reuters that Northvolt could build the factory in Germany, as well as another one in North America. However, this has not yet been set in stone. It was recently rumoured that Northvolt could build its North American factory in the Canadian province of Quebec.\n\nbmwk.de'}...

Acquire Licensing Rights\n\nSummary\n\nCompanies Northvolt could invest 3-5 bln euros in plant - sources\n\nOver 600 mln subsidies for Northvolt pending approval - source\n\nEurope, U.S. jostling for green industrial investments\n\nNorthvolt may build two plants in parallel - spokesperson\n\nSTOCKHOLM/BERLIN, May 12 (Reuters) - Two electric vehicle battery makers plan to spend around 10 billion euros ($11 billion) on factories in Europe, they said on Friday, after Europe loosened state aid rules for green industry projects in a bid to win the subsidy race with the U.S.\n\nBoth plants will start production in 2026, employ thousands of people and supply batteries to European car makers.\n\nAfter months of worry that it would opt for an investment in North America over Europe, Sweden's Northvolt said it is set to pick Heide in northern Germany for its factory as long as subsidies are approved, estimated by one source close to the matter to be over 600 million euros.\n\nTaiwan's ProLogium, meanwhile, announced a new plant in the French city of Dunkirk after France offered deal sweeteners and competitive power prices, executives from the company said.\n\nWith Taiwan a focal point in tensions between Washington and Beijing, the company also wanted to secure a base overseas.\n\nEurope, home to carmakers such as Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) and BMW (BMWG.DE), has been trying to lower dependency on Asian countries for batteries that will power green electric cars, though the region still relies heavily on Asia for sourcing and processing raw materials like lithium, cobalt and manganese.\n\nHigh energy prices and a lack of subsidies comparable to the $430-billion U.S. Inflation Reduction Act has prompted companies from Volkswagen to utility Enel and cement maker Holcim to call on the European Union to do more to encourage investment.\n\nVolkswagen was expected to announce a battery plant location in Europe late last year but said in March it is awaiting more clarity from Europe on subsidies before making a decision.\n\nFor Northvolt, Europe's 'Temporary Crisis and Transition Framework' (TCTF) which simplifies conditions for countries to grant aid to green projects and allowed Germany more freedom in offering support for the battery plant, helped firm up its plans to build in the region, a spokesperson said.\n\nHow energy prices could be brought down was unclear, the spokesperson added, though supply is not a concern given high amounts of offshore wind near the plant's planned location.\n\nNorthvolt, alongside Volkswagen, is the furthest ahead among just a handful of European players paving the way for a home-grown battery industry, with a large chunk of planned capacity in Europe to be owned by Asian players.\n\nThe plant by Taiwan's ProLogium would be its first overseas car battery factory. French President Emmanuel Macron lobbied for the factory to beat other contestants like Germany and the Netherlands.\n\nBoth Germany and France sweetened the subsidy pot after the U.S. last year unveiled its major tax subsidies to boost domestic manufacturing.\n\nThe subsidies for Northvolt would be the first provided by Germany under Europe's TCTF programme, adopted in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine and expanded this year to support green transition projects.\n\nThe support still needs the approval of the European Commission.\n\nA second plant could also be constructed in parallel elsewhere, a Northvolt spokesperson said, including in North America.\n\nForeign and domestic companies have invested in Germany to feed its growing EV industry. CATL (300750.SZ), which has been expanding rapidly outside China, is ramping up production of its plant near Erfurt in Germany and BASF (BASFn.DE) is building a battery materials site in Schwarzheide, eastern Germany.\n\nU.S. Microvast (MVST.O), meanwhile, built a factory in Ludwigsfelde, south of Berlin.\n\n(This story has been corrected to say production, not construction in paragraph 2)\n\nReporting by Victoria Waldersee, Supantha Mukherjee, Andreas Rinke Editing by Friederike Heine, Mark Potter and Sharon Singleton\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."}...
Article 3: {'title': 'Sweden’s Northvolt unveils new sodium-ion cell technology amid EV demand surge', 'published_date': '2023-11-21 00:00:00', 'keywords': [], 'text': "Swedish battery maker Northvolt has developed a new sodium-ion cell technology and could ramp up production of batteries in the next few years.\n\nThe demand for critical minerals such as lithium, cobalt and platinum has surged in recent years as electric vehicles (EV) become increasingly popular, prompting car manufacturers and battery makers to look for alternatives.\n\nNorthvolt’s sodium-ion batteries do not contain lithium, cobalt and platinum, which can pose cost and environmental challenges.\n\n“Sodium-ion batteries are not new … it’s been talked [about] and being developed for a period of time,” Peter Carlsson, Northvolt’s chief executive, told The National.\n\n“But what we have managed to achieve with this product … it’s really high performance and the highest energy density so far that we have seen on the market.”\n\nNorthvolt’s sodium-ion cell has an energy density of 160-watt hour / kilogram (Wh/kg), compared to lithium-ion battery's 180–250 Wh/kg.\n\nA high-energy-density battery lasts longer and delivers the same energy in a smaller footprint compared to a lower-energy-density battery.\n\nThe company will engage in more product development and in defining an “efficient” manufacturing blueprint as the new batteries would be manufactured in Northvolt’s current factories, Mr Carlsson said.\n\nNorthvolt could ramp up the production of the batteries in the next few years following the completion of the development phase, he said.\n\n“If you take a 10-year perspective, I think this has the opportunity to, volume wise, be as big as the [company’s] current portfolio of high-performance nickel batteries [and] potentially even more,” he said.\n\nNorthvolt, which mostly supplies lithium-ion batteries to car makers, is preparing for an initial public offering in Stockholm that could value the company at more than $20 billion, Reuters reported earlier this year, citing sources.\n\nIt has secured more than $55 billion worth of orders from customers such as BMW, Scania, Volvo and Volkswagen.\n\nSodium-ion cell is also more heat resistant than lithium-ion batteries, making it ideal for smart grids in large cities as well utility-scale solar projects, Mr Carlsson said.\n\nThat also means Northvolt could supply its batteries to countries in the Middle East and North Africa region, home to many large renewable energy plants.\n\n“I think it [sodium-ion cell] opens up expansion for both building manufacturing capacity as well as larger deployments in the region and we are just starting conversations around this,” Mr Carlsson said.\n\n“In the light of the big aspirations in the region towards green transition, we think it is a very interesting market.”\n\nGCC countries have been investing heavily in renewable energy and sustainable development in a bid to diversify away from hydrocarbon exports.\n\nThe UAE, the first country in the Mena region to announce a target of net zero by 2050, has been funding clean energy projects, including solar and wind, as it cuts down on the use of natural gas for electricity production.\n\nSwedish electric battery plant Northvolt, which counts BMW and Volkswagen among its investors, last year delivered its first battery cells from its gigafactory in Sweden. Photo: Northvolt AB\n\nSaudi Arabia, which plans to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2060, is focusing heavily on building its domestic EV market to support the transition and develop its local manufacturing sector as part of its Vision 2030 strategy.\n\n“We will follow where we clearly see there is a build-up of demand. Obviously, as the region is also building up an ecosystem, that is very interesting,” Mr Carlsson said.\n\nIn September, Northvolt announced that it would open a $5.2 billion gigafactory in Quebec, which is expected to become operational in 2026.\n\nNorth America, which has car brands such as Tesla, Ford and General Motors, is the third-largest EV market in the world behind China and Europe.\n\nHowever, the US Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) enacted last year has prompted several clean energy companies to expand in the region, driven by subsidies and cheaper energy.\n\n“It was very important in our decision-making to invest in scaling up in North America,” Mr Carlsson said.\n\n“Establishing this industry requires a lot of capital and it also comes with pretty big start-up costs. North America with the IRA kind of found an incentive formula that really supports that, and it's been pretty effective if you see how much investment and activity it has generated.”\n\nNorthvolt’s announcement comes against the backdrop of a rising geopolitical rivalry between the US and China in the pursuit of critical minerals.\n\n“The uncertainty [regarding] where the whole world is going is of course creating very high raw materials fluctuations, and that is never good because it prevents long term planning,” Mr Carlsson said.\n\nThe increasing “polarisation” of the world is prompting each region of the world to develop its own EV supply chain and it would have “happened anyway” as car makers follow “just-in-time” manufacturing, where inventory levels are kept as low as possible to reduce costs, he said.\n\nMeanwhile, global electric car sales are set to surge by 35 per cent this year, helped by government subsidies and the tightening of carbon dioxide emissions standards, according to the International Energy Agency.\n\nElectric car sales are projected to reach 14 million in 2023 from 10 million last year, the Paris-based agency said in its Global Electric Vehicle Outlook in April.\n\nElectric vehicles will make up about half of the new car sales worldwide by 2035 as the push for net-zero carbon emissions accelerates, according to Goldman Sachs Research."}...
Article 4: {'title': 'Northvolt to build third gigafactory in northern Germany', 'published_date': '2022-03-15 06:11:47+00:00', 'keywords': [], 'text': 'Northvolt signs Memorandum of Understanding with the north German state of Schleswig-Holstein and the region of Heide for the development of a 60 GWh lithium-ion battery manufacturing plant\n\nThe gigafactory, Northvolt Drei, is to employ 3,000 persons and produce its first batteries in late 2025\n\nPowered by the cleanest electricity grid in Germany, Northvolt Drei is positioned to produce the cleanest batteries in continental Europe\n\nStockholm/Heide â\x80\x93 Today Northvolt announces its intention to establish a battery gigafactory in Heide, Schleswig-Holstein, northern Germany. With an annual potential production capacity of 60 GWh, Northvolt Drei will deliver a supply of sustainably produced lithium-ion batteries to the European market, sufficient for some one million electric vehicles.\n\nThe new gigafactory increases Northvoltâ\x80\x99s pipeline of battery manufacturing capacity under development to over 170 GWh, thereby advancing the company on its mission to deliver batteries in a manner characterized by clean energy and circularity that is fundamentally different from approaches dominating the global industry today.\n\nPeter Carlsson, Co-Founder and CEO of Northvolt, comments: â\x80\x9cWeâ\x80\x99re excited to announce Northvolt Drei â\x80\x93 a project which fits well into a promising future cluster of clean technology ventures emerging in northern Germany and advances the wider European transition towards a sustainable society within which Germany plays a crucial role.â\x80\x9d\n\nEnvisioned to produce its first batteries in 2025 and provide some 3,000 new jobs, a central intention of Northvolt Drei is to deliver high-performance lithium-ion batteries, produced with the lowest environmental footprint in continental Europe.\n\nThe selection of Heide, Schleswig-Holstein, is key to fulfilment of this objective. The region hosts the cleanest energy grid in Germany, one which is characterized by a surplus of electricity generated by onshore and offshore wind power and reinforced by clean energy provided through grid interconnections to Denmark and Norway.\n\nâ\x80\x9cIt matters how we produce a battery cell. If you use coal in your production, you embed a fair amount of CO2 into your battery, but if we use clean energy, we can build a very sustainable product. Our philosophy is that new energy-intensive industries, such as battery manufacturing, should be established in actual geographical proximity to where the clean energy is produced,â\x80\x9d says Peter Carlsson.\n\nIt is not only an abundance of clean energy which positions the region of Heide and broader industrial landscape surrounding Hamburg as ideally suited to hosting Northvoltâ\x80\x99s expanding presence in Europe.\n\nIn addition to being centrally positioned in the emerging European battery supply chain connecting Scandinavia and continental Europe, the region also provides the space required to establish a battery plant of sufficient size to leverage the economies of scale in production which are key to reducing battery costs.\n\nAccess to German industrial competence and automotive expertise will provide additional opportunities. Local manufacturing expertise of the Schleswig-Holstein region and Heide will ensure the factory is delivering batteries of the highest quality, while the factory itself will provide critical labor force experience with battery technology â\x80\x93 an emerging cornerstone technology of the European economy.\n\nWith sustainability at the forefront of design and decision-making surrounding Northvolt Drei, the factory will source significant volumes of its raw material requirements from recycled battery metals, as part of Northvoltâ\x80\x99s commitment to source 50 percent of its raw material needs from recycling by 2030.\n\nAlongside battery production, Northvolt Drei will target an on-site battery recycling plant which will ensure efficient reuse of byproducts from the production process and provide a sustainable solution for end-of-life electric vehicle batteries recovered from European markets.\n\nAcross the full scope of the project, Northvolt is eager to bring the companyâ\x80\x99s commitment to transparency and straightforwardness into its dealings with external stakeholders. That approach has proven successful in Sweden, in Norway and in Poland, and there is every reason to believe it will underpin delivery of another project with Northvolt Drei.\n\nChristofer Haux, interim CEO of Northvolt Drei, comments: â\x80\x9cWe look forward to engaging with communities and authorities of Schleswig-Holstein to ensure that Northvolt Drei is developed in a transparent and collaborative manner that makes the most of the many opportunities the project represents for the region.â\x80\x9d\n\nRead more about a future career at Northvolt Drei.\n\nAbout Northvolt\n\nNorthvolt is a European supplier of sustainable, high-quality battery cells and systems. Founded in 2016 to enable the European transition to a decarbonized future, the company has made swift progress on its mission to deliver the worldâ\x80\x99s greenest lithium-ion battery with a minimal CO2 footprint and has grown to over 2,500 people from over 100 different nationalities.\n\nNorthvolt has to date secured in excess of $50 billion worth of contracts from key customers, including BMW, Fluence, Scania, Volkswagen, Volvo Cars and Polestar, to support its plans, which include establishing recycling capabilities to enable 50 percent of all its raw material requirements to be sourced from recycled batteries by 2030.'}...
