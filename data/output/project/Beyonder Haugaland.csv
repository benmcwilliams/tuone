"Beyonder selects Haugalandet, Norway for large-scale battery venture",2022-04-04 00:00:00,"In the press conference held at Haugaland Industry Park on April 4 Beyonder announced their plans for large-scale battery production in Norway. The Norwegian government’s goals of increased export and thus signals of active support for the battery industry became the deciding factor.

Beyonder is developing a new technology for sustainable battery cells using active carbon from Norwegian sawdust to replace materials cobalt and nickel. The battery cells are particularly useful in the energy intensive industry that needs high effects.

Beyonder is today located at Forus in Rogaland where they have established a small-scale production line for the first battery cells. The decision today marks a significant step forward for the large-scale production of battery cells.

– It is no secret that we have considered other European countries for our large-scale factory. But the new and clear signals from the Norwegian government promising competitive operating conditions for the battery industry made it an easy decision. It is now time for us to step up our game with our homeland Norway as our location, says CEO and founder of Beyonder, Svein Kvernstuen.

Terje Aasland – The Minister of Petroleum and Energy is very pleased with the announcement from Beyonder. The scale-up building of the factory will give about 5oo direct jobs in the industry region of Haugalandet. As we scale our production we will employ approx 2000 people. This comes in addition to a significant amount of people that will build the factory, and a large amount of subcontractors.

– As someone with a soft spot for industrial development we are very pleased that the industry is looking at Norway. We will facilitate long-term and stable conditions and ensure that the industry will want to invest in Norway, says Terje Aasland.

Another key factor for Beyonder to reach their conclusion was to find a location with already established industry surrounding it for cooperation and value chain synergies. Haugaland Industry Park offers all of this.

– Beyonder is striving to find synergies with already well-established industry as well as industry that wants to locate here. It’s a huge advantage that this region already has valuable industry competence and experience from the process industry. The well-run educational institutions here will be an advantage for us. Holistic solutions, large-zoned areas ready for new industry together with sustainable logistics solutions is essential for our project in the upcoming years, Steinar Lea, COO in Beyonder, tells us.

Tiril Fjeld, CEO in Haugaland Industry Park, points out that this agreement signals a new phase for the industry park. For the last 20 years their focus has been on developing the vast area with heavy investments in zoning and infrastructure, including the deep kay and harbor at Gismarvik.

– It is a great pleasure to welcome Beyonder, the first large-scale factory in Norway’s largest zoned industrial park. Beyonder will definitely have on impact on the way we shape and develop during the next phase of the park. But we will still have great areas for other industries in the battery value chain as well as other industries that can work in synergy with the factory. Thus, we are happy that Beyonder is going to be one of several establishments competing in the world race from Haugaland Industry Park, says Tiril Fjeld.",https://haugaland-park.no/2022/04/04/beyonder-selects-haugalandet-norway-for-large-scale-battery-venture/
News — Beyonder,,"The Rogaland duo strengthens Norway's position in the World Cup on green large-scale industrial establishments. This became clear during a press conference at Haugaland Næringspark on Monday 4 April. Beyonder wants to keep its battery production in Norway, based on the government's signals of a major investment in battery, increased exports and electricity to the industry.",https://www.beyonder.no/latest-news
Beyonder chooses Norway for its first large-scale battery venture. — Beyonder,,"Beyonder is developing its own technology for sustainable battery cells, based on, among other things, active carbon from Norwegian sawdust. The battery cells are particularly well suited for power-intensive manufacturing and transport with a need for high power. Beyonder is currently located at Forus in Rogaland, where they have established a small-scale production line. Today, they are taking a big step forward in their plans for large-scale battery cell production.



– We have made no secret of the fact that we have assessed foreign locations for our large-scale factory. But with clear signals from the Government that they want to ensure internationally competitive framework conditions for large-scale battery cell production, everything is in place for us to reach the world championships here from Norway,"" says Svein Kvernstuen, Founder and CEO of Beyonder.



Minister of Petroleum and Energy Terje Aasland is pleased that Beyonder is now looking towards Norway for its full-scale production. The step-by-step factory development will already create between 500-600 direct jobs in an otherwise industry heavy region of Haugalandet. Full scale factory, with up to 10 production lines, will create around 2,000 direct jobs. In addition, you have all the jobs created in the construction period, and the establishment of supplier industry and other rip-off effects for local businesses.



– For an industry by heart kind of guy, I am very happy that the industry is turning its attention to Norway. We will facilitate long-term, good, safe conditions and ensure industry investments in Norway, says Minister of Petroleum and Energy Terje Aasland.



For Beyonder, it has been important to find a location with an established industrial muscle that can support an overall industry scale establishment. They found that in the Haugalandet region.",https://www.beyonder.no/latest-news/beyonder-chooses-norway-instead-of-going-abroad-with-its-large-scale-battery-venture
Beyonder launches their first cell to market,2023-11-06 08:34:46+00:00,"Exciting news from the Nordic batter industry. On 30 October 2023, Beyonder, a Norwegian cell development and manufacturing company, launched it’s first certified product “BePowered”.



It is a 31Ah (1C) lithium-ion pouch cell (detailed specifications found here), with more than 10 000 cycles, with 5C/5C charge and discharge capabilities.
