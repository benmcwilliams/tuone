InoBat provides operational update following significant 2022 progress,,"InoBat provides operational update following significant 2022 progress

Battery manufacturing pilot line to be completed Q1 2023 with current workforce set to double when operational

Voderady to act as R&D epicentre in Slovakia, supporting planned portfolio of gigafactories in Europe and US

Significant partnerships and MOUs signed over the last year

Clear progress made towards future growth plans

London / Bratislava, 15 December 2022: InoBat (“InoBat” or the “Company”), the European pioneer of premium electric battery R&D, engineering, and production, today provides an operational update following the achievement of key development milestones this year and the significant progress made towards the Company’s future growth plans.

In summer 2021, InoBat began the construction of its EV battery R&D and pilot line facility on a brownfield site in Voderady, Slovakia. With a footprint of ~9,500 sqm, the site has progressed rapidly and now encompasses state-of-the-art laboratories, a dedicated R&D centre and a manufacturing pilot line, all on track to be commissioned in Q1 2023. The facility will be the epicentre of InoBat’s agile approach to product development, providing an “all-in-one” location solution – from chemistry research and cell development to battery production and recycling capability. This successfully showcases InoBat’s “cradle-to-cradle” circular economy approach in support of the Sustainable Development Goals of the UN (SDG 2030), which heavily influenced the decision to use an existing site to house InoBat’s first operations, reducing the need for carbon intensive construction methods.

The facility continues to progress swiftly and is on track to be up and running as planned in Q1 2023, with the production of tailor-made electric battery cells for InoBat’s customers set to begin shortly afterwards. With customer orders already signed, the facility’s current employee base will more than double to 150 as the site becomes fully operational, with one-third of the employee-base remaining entirely focused on R&D and product development. The facility will benefit significantly from Slovakia’s wealth of engineering talent and the intellectual capability developed at Voderady will sustain all of InoBat’s future sites.

This is only the first stage of development, however, as InoBat’s modular approach will enable the scale up of the plant in stages to ensure its expansion is in line with offtake demand, allowing the initial ~45MWh per annum capability to grow to gigafactory scale in a considered manner. As well as ensuring future capacity can be added smoothly without interrupting operations, this approach will also support production flexibility and the future-proofing of InoBat’s operations as processes evolve.

InoBat’s significant progress builds on the foundations that were carefully laid at its creation in 2019, with much of the past three years focused on investing in its own proprietary R&D, taking the view that European companies must develop their own ideas if they are to compete with established international manufacturers in Asia. For InoBat, it has been key to take a customer-focused approach and concentrate on creating the right product for customer needs before building very large, giga scale manufacturing facilities. Collaboration is key for success and, importantly, InoBat has already signed customer agreements with players in the commercial vehicle industry and the electric vertical take-off and landing aircraft sector, with the first cells already shipped and $2 million of initial revenues realised. In addition, InoBat benefits from an extensive further pipeline and is currently in discussions with 30+ parties.

Marian Bocek, CEO of InoBat Auto, commented: “I am incredibly pleased with the progress that has been made since we began developing our Voderady site just over a year ago. What was once a disused building is now an advanced research, development, and production facility with a top calibre R&D and operations team, all sitting under one roof.

“At the heart of our success is InoBat’s truly differentiated approach to produce tailor-made EV battery solutions, understanding that no two customers’ needs are alike. Our bespoke batteries provide customers with longer range, longer lifecycle, higher energy density and faster charging time – and most importantly, we develop our products first before scaling up our manufacturing capability. With tailor-made products for key customers under our belt, supported by an excellent R&D and operational team, we have all we need to succeed and will continue to drive forward on our journey to become a leading player in green mobility.”

The significant progress of InoBat’s Voderady facility is just the first operational step towards a global ambition to drive the transition towards EV mobility whilst localising value-chains through local partnerships and alliances. InoBat currently has a portfolio of projects under development in Europe and the US with plans that will see InoBat develop a network of sites and, eventually, gigafactories, with local partners. This important step began in June 2022, when InoBat announced plans – along with cornerstone investor, Ideanomics, and the State of Indiana – to develop a new facility in Indiana. This was swiftly followed by the announcement of InoBat’s planned site in Serbia, with support from the Government of Serbia and IFC. InoBat will also soon be announcing the location of the company’s third gigafactory, planned for Western Europe, with declarations of intent signed with authorities in Spain although other locations, such as the UK, remain under consideration.

These three gigafactories – one in Eastern Europe (Serbia), one in Western Europe (location to be confirmed) and one in the US (Indiana) – will all be developed in a phased approach aligned with offtake demand, in 4GWh modules until they reach full-scale gigafactories. These future facilities will be supported by the intellectual capability produced at InoBat’s existing Voderady site as well as its first UK site at the University of Warwick Science Park’s Warwick Innovation Centre.

Gotion and InoBat outline key points for cell factory in Central Europe,2023-09-19 00:00:00,"The Chinese battery cell manufacturer and Volkswagen partner Gotion High-Tech has just signed a “pre-joint venture agreement” with Slovakian battery company InoBat in Berlin. The main goal is the operation of a joint battery cell factory in Europe, the construction of which could begin next year. The agreement follows a non-binding letter of intent between the two companies in February 2023 and a 25 per cent stake in InoBat announced by Gotion about two weeks ago.

But first things first. What is known so far is that the joint battery cell factory will have an annual capacity of 20 GWh in the first phase. According to InoBat, the decision on the location has not yet been finalised, but the focus is on the “Middle-European region.” Other than that, the company remains rather general: “The future gigafactory should cover an area of more than 100 hectares and create thousands of jobs.” The partners expect it to be fully operational by 2026.

InoBat CEO Marián Boček lists “strong support from the state and state institutions in building critical infrastructure, construction permits and providing competitive state aid” as key factors for the investment decision and expresses that “Slovakia has the opportunity to fight for the location of the factory and thus be competitive in the field of electromobility.” The partnership with Gotion High-Tech is thus strategically important for InoBat in several areas.

Steven Cai, board member and CTO of Gotion, comments that InoBat has impressed his company with its strong expertise in research and development of its own batteries. “This gigafactory is to meet the localisation demand from our European customers currently supplied out of China as well as our new customer nominations in Europe soon to be announced,” he says, without going more into detail.

Gotion supplies batteries to Volkswagen, among others – the Wolfsburg company has been the largest single shareholder since 2021. On the one hand, Gotion is a technology partner for the PowerCo battery cell factory in Salzgitter. On the other, it is also building its own cell production in Göttingen. So, the cooperation with InoBat is not the first European activity for the Chinese.

The plans of the Chinese-Slovak alliance had already become apparent. Two weeks ago, Gotion High-Tech announced that it would take over a quarter of InoBat. The duo did not disclose the financial details of the investment.

InoBat calls the deal a “Gotion-InoBat-Batteries (GIB) transaction” and stresses that Gotion High-Tech has “committed significant capital and technology support to ensure and safeguard InoBat’s success of the GIB framework.” According to the Slovaks, this is the “first such major investment by a top tier Chinese global battery maker in a European premier startup with a significant portfolio of IP Industrialisation and scale-up projects […].”

When Gotion’s entry was announced, it was already said to focus on localising the battery value chain for customers – with an initial focus on Central and Eastern Europe and developing “green battery materials” in Morocco.",https://www.electrive.com/2023/09/19/gotion-and-inobat-outline-key-points-for-cell-factory-in-central-europe/
InoBat Auto tests battery assembly and cell production in the USA,2022-06-24 00:00:00,"Slovakian battery company InoBat Auto and US electric vehicle specialist Ideanomics are planning a three-stage battery development and production project in the US state of Indiana.

+ + Kindly see our update below + +

The first stage envisages an R&D and production facility for battery modules and packs with an initial annual production capacity of 100 MWh. The second stage envisions a commercial-scale battery module and pack assembly plant with an initial annual production capacity of 2 to 3 GWh. The first two phases would be supplied by cells from InoBat’s European plants.

The option of building a battery cell production facility in Indiana with an initial annual capacity of 4 GWh is also being explored. The latter is to be done “in line with future offtake agreements”. In other words, if Ideanomics can better foresee how sales of its electric utility vehicles will develop in North America, InoBat will be in a better position to assess if and when a US cell production will be profitable.

The two companies chose Indiana because of its “high concentration of OEMs, suitable business conditions for industrial projects and government support”, according to the statement. The Indiana government has pledged “administrative, advisory, fiscal and site support” for the project. InoBat has not disclosed details on the financial scope of the support.

Instead, InoBat gives details on the battery technology: the company’s business model is to quickly develop customised battery solutions for customer vehicles. This is currently being done on the basis of InoBat’s first battery cell generation, an NCM622 pouch cell. Compared to a benchmark cell from Asia, it is said to be able to charge from five to 80 per cent 25 per cent faster, to have a 20 per cent longer service life and to offer 28 per cent better capacity maintenance at -20 degrees Celsius.

Ideanomics already invested in InoBat earlier this year. “This partnership demonstrates our continuing effort to make EV the natural mobility successor,” Ideanomics CEO Alf Poor said of the Indiana plans. “It has been our mission to expedite the innovations needed to accelerate EV adoption. Our partnership with InoBat will secure future battery supply and create a force multiplier for technologies across our operating companies. This is another reflection of our commitment to boost clean technology job opportunities in the US.”

Update 2 November 2022:

Slovakian company InoBat Auto and Ideanomics have secured the necessary subsidies from the US state of Indiana to advance their battery project there. The incentive package, the amount of which has not been disclosed, includes tax credits, rebates, cash grants and training grants that InoBat and Ideanomics will be eligible for once they have made their investment in Indiana and hired and trained local workers.

“We were thrilled to meet Inobat on our overseas business development trip to Slovakia earlier in the year and are excited to now welcome InoBat and Ideanomics to Indiana to grow and scale their dynamic business for the US market”, said Indiana Secretary of Commerce Brad Chambers. “With Indiana’s innovative economy and our push toward manufacturing the products necessary for the energy transition, the timing is perfect for Inobat and Ideanomics to open the doors in the Hoosier state.”

The first stage of the project, as mentioned above, envisions an R&D and manufacturing facility for battery modules and packs with an initial annual production capacity of 100 MWh in Indianapolis. Construction of the facility is scheduled to begin in the first quarter of 2023, and assembly in 2024.

InoBat was founded in 2019, and is jointly headquartered in both Slovakia and the UK. The young company has to date raised and committed 91 million euros from convertible loans, equity financing, EU and governmental funds. The company is currently in its Series C round to fuel its expansion plans.

Ideanomics retains the right to offtake battery modules and packs from the facility for use in its Solectrac and Energica electric vehicles. In 2021, Ideanomics began acquiring Via Motors. Once this is complete, Ideanomics will also make InoBat’s battery solutions available for use in VIA vehicles.

This declaration of intent represents the decision and mutual support of both parties to establish a facility in Serbia and if finalised, the relevant Serbian authorities will work with InoBat to secure all of the permits and licenses required for the sustainable construction and operation of the gigafactory. The Serbian government will also provide financial and material support to ensure the successful development of the facility. InoBat has already established its Serbian subsidiary, InoBat Auto Beograd. This initiative is supported by IFC via its early-stage project development engagement with InoBat to establish a new EV battery factory in Central and Southeast Europe, signed in January of this year.

Ana Brnabic, Prime Minister of the Serbian government commented: “This is an important milestone for Serbia in positioning our country as a great contributor to sustainable and green future and among leading European players in this highly innovative and ground-breaking strategic industrial sector. The InoBat investment is more proof of our efforts to ensure that Serbia is developing in line with the newest technological and industrial trends and that our country is a top investment destination. We will continue to work resolutely on further development in order to create an even better conditions for the well-being of both our citizens and everyone who lives and does business in Serbia.”

Ary Naim, Regional Manager for Central and Southeast Europe of the International Finance Corporation added: “Serbia is well positioned to continue attracting manufacturing investment, and become a centrepiece for the E-mobility revolution in Europe, creating new jobs and opportunities in the economy of tomorrow for decades to come. An InoBat gigafactory in Serbia could serve as the anchor that will catalyse much more investment up and down regional manufacturing value chains.”

Marian Bocek, CEO of InoBat said: “The Serbian government have been exceptional partners and I am incredibly grateful for their ongoing support. The agreement reflects our shared ambition for the future of green mobility and the importance of fostering sustainable growth models. This additional step builds on InoBat’s progress over the past three years and is an exciting sign of what’s to come. Our pilot facility in Slovakia is near completion, and we have lined up the development of a new facility in the US and recently signed declarations of intent for the construction of a facility in Spain. I look forward to working alongside the Republic of Serbia as we progress towards a greener more sustainable future.”

This development represents further progress on InoBat’s plan to develop a global network of gigafactories based on its “cradle-to-cradle” circular value chain, which integrates chemistry research, cell development, battery production and material recycling in one location. InoBat is currently developing its main R&D hub in Voderady, Slovakia, which is progressing rapidly with the battery manufacturing line to be completed Q1 2023 and has recently announced that it has secured the necessary regional incentives to progress the development of its first North American facility in Indiana, which will create up to 80 full-time manufacturing jobs. In three years since inception, InoBat has already signed customer agreements with companies in the commercial vehicle and electric vertical take-off and landing aircraft sectors, with the first cells shipped and initial revenues realised, and benefits from an extensive further pipeline.

InoBat: Construction begins on first-of-its-kind electric vehicle battery technology centre and pilot line,2021-06-02 16:41:23+00:00,"European battery producer, InoBat to develop ‘newest battery technology’ on-site

Construction has today begun on a first-of-its-kind electric vehicle (EV) battery R&D centre and pilot line in Slovakia, integrating proprietary R&D activities together with battery cell-manufacturing capabilities under one roof.

Set to be operational in early 2022, the new battery centre is being built by leading European electric vehicle battery developer and producer, InoBat Auto (“InoBat”), who is developing premium batteries which can be quickly and efficiently tailored to meet the specifications of any electric vehicle.

Powered by green energy through grid electricity and solar panels, the 290,000 ft²(27,000m²) site will create up to 150 skilled jobs, and will include a technical training centre, modern office space, research labs and manufacturing line. InoBat, who purchased the existing brownfield site to reduce the need for carbon intensive construction methods, will use the new battery centre, to identify the optimum cell chemistries to meet the exact requirements of any vehicle maker or manufacturer faster and more efficiently than competitors.

Co-Founder and CEO of InoBat Auto, Marian Bocek, celebrated the groundbreaking ceremony alongside Boris Kollar, Speaker of the National Council of the Slovak Republic, Maroš Šefčovič, Vice-President of the European Commission, Vazil Hudak, the EU SME Convoy, Faysal Sohail, InoBat’s Chairman, and InoBat’s Vice Chair, Andy Palmer, who was responsible for building the UK’s first electric vehicle battery manufacturing facility in 2009 during his time as Chief Operating Officer of Nissan.

European Commission Vice-President, Maroš Šefčovič, in charge of the European Battery Alliance, said: “I am delighted that the private sector is maintaining the momentum built up by the European Battery Alliance. This ambitious new InoBat Auto project represents another significant stepping stone towards building a competitive, innovative and sustainable battery value chain here in Europe. This will help bolster our strategic autonomy and protect millions of jobs in the face of increasing global competition – particularly important in Central Europe.”

“The European Commission will therefore continue to mobilise all industrial actors, Member States and the European Investment Bank to shift things into a higher gear – leveraging investment, establishing a fit-for-future regulatory framework, building our raw materials resilience and upskilling people to meet the fast-growing needs of the battery ecosystem – so that our automotive industry can stay out in front.”

The site, located 40km outside of Bratislava in Voderady, is situated in the centre of Central Europe’s automotive hub, with more than 4.25 million vehicles produced annually in a 500 km radius from the facility. InoBat is also preparing to build a 1GWh Gigafactory in Voderady, Slovakia before scaling up to a 32GWh Gigafactory to support and serve the international market at scale.

Marian Bocek, Co-Founder and CEO of InoBat, commented: “On behalf of InoBat, our partners and our dedicated investors, we are thrilled construction is now underway and look forward to rapidly developing the newest battery technology to help accelerate the much-needed electrification of all forms of transport from our world-class hub here in Slovakia.”

“Our new home, which sits in the heart of the European vehicle and automaker ecosystem, will become a centre of excellence for battery development, and we look forward to working with current and future partners to deliver the best batteries customised directly to meet exact specifications for electric vehicle in the automotive, aviation, commercial and industrial sectors.”

The landmark event comes just five weeks after InoBat signed a landmark agreement with SOR, one of the largest producers of city and intercity-buses in Central Europe, with the intention to design, develop and supply batteries for a new urban, intercity and long-distance electric bus fleet.

InoBat has also announced a strategic partnership with leader in automation, industrial software and intelligent infrastructure, Siemens, to digitalize InoBat’s entire value chain for electric vehicle battery production. InoBat will use Siemens’ solutions to develop a holistic digital factory approach throughout its R&D battery centre and production line, which was designed by architectural firm, Takenaka.

InoBat is backed by a strong consortium of investors and technology companies, including lead investor IPM Group (IPM) – the fastest growing InfraTech asset managers who specialise in bringing ground-breaking technologies from Silicon Valley to Europe – strategic investors and partners include CEZ (strategic investment of EUR 10m) Matador, AEN, MSM Group, Across and Wildcat Discovery Technologies.
