DOUVRIN, FRANCE – Stellantis, together with TotalEnergies and Mercedes-Benz, celebrated today the inauguration of Automotive Cells Company’s (ACC) battery gigafactory in Billy-Berclau Douvrin, France, the first of three planned in Europe.

With an initial production line capacity of 13 gigawatt-hours (GWh), rising to 40GWh by 2030, the facility will deliver high-performance lithium-ion batteries with a minimal CO 2 footprint. The first of the site’s three European production units will be operational before the end of 2023.

The gigafactory will contribute to Stellantis’ goal of increasing battery manufacturing capacity to 250 GWh in Europe by 2030 and advance the Company on its mission to offer a comprehensive suite of battery technologies that supports customers’ needs across the entire Stellantis brand portfolio. Stellantis is securing approximately 400 GWh of capacity by 2030, supported by five gigafactories in Europe and North America and additional supply contracts.

“At the outset of this partnership in 2020, we agreed to an ambitious global timeline to develop electric vehicle batteries that would power our plan to electrify mobility,” said Carlos Tavares, Stellantis CEO. “As we execute our Dare Forward 2030 strategy and now move to hit our ambitious target of achieving carbon net zero by 2038, Stellantis is actively contributing to the European electrification transition with state-of-the-art EV solutions and supporting France’s crucial role in a sustainable future. I applaud every person involved in ACC for together we are building a strong coalition to strengthen Europe’s competitiveness.”

The Company now has 24 BEVs in market and will nearly double that to 47 by the end of 2024. Stellantis targets having more than 75 BEVs globally and global BEV sales of 5 million by 2030. Today, Stellantis electric vehicles the Peugeot e-208 and Fiat New 500 are among the top five best-sellers in France and in the top 10 in Europe.

As battery chemistries continuously evolve, Stellantis is exploring all technologies to meet the diverse needs of its broad customer base and ensure clean, safe and affordable mobility. Promising innovative solutions like Factorial’s solid-state battery technology and Lyten’s lithium-sulfur batteries may help enable enhanced vehicle performance and customer experience, creating a more sustainable electric vehicle experience for all.

Alongside battery production, Stellantis, ACC, the Union of Metallurgies Industries, the state and region are establishing the Battery Training Center of Douvrin as part of its upskilling and reskilling program. Through a 400-hour course, Stellantis employees will acquire new skills in battery manufacturing, helping the Hauts-de-France region compete in a sector that is crucial to the electrification transition. By 2025, at least 600 employees will join the battery manufacturing plant.

As part of the Dare Forward 2030 strategic plan, Stellantis announced plans of reaching 100% of the passenger car battery electric vehicle (BEV) sales mix in Europe and 50% of passenger car and light-duty truck BEV sales mix in the United States by 2030. Stellantis is on track to become a carbon net zero corporation, all scopes included, by 2038, with single-digit percentage compensation of the remaining emissions.

Founded in 2020, ACC is a joint venture between Stellantis, Mercedes-Benz and TotalEnergies, through its affiliate Saft, which is behind the technology used by ACC. ACC is positioned as a key player in the battery industry to equip high-performance, low-carbon electric vehicles that are accessible to the greatest number of people.",https://totalenergies.com/news/inauguration-accs-first-gigafactory-european-mega-project-battery-production
Eiffage to build ACC’s first electric battery gigafactory in Douvrin (France) in a contract worth almost €75 million,,"The consortium led by Eiffage Génie Civil also includes Eiffage Métal, Eiffage Énergie Systèmes and Eiffage Route, along with three partners: Moretti Constructions, Bemaco and Exyte.

The contract covers general contracting Package 1, for construction of a building 644 m long, 94 m wide and between 10 and 34 m high. The project also includes 20 related structures and the renovation of an existing 17,000 sq.m building, for a total surface area of 60,000 sq.m with 36,000 sq.m of access roads. Works started in January 2022 and are expected to take 12 months, running concurrently with three other works packages.

This gigafactory is set to become the first of its type in France when commissioned in April 2023, and will boast annual production capacity of 8 GWh.

This new contract is the fourth secured by Eiffage in connection with this project, which integrates perfectly into the Group’s drive to support its customers with their low-carbon projects. In mid-2021, Stellantis awarded Eiffage’s deconstruction subsidiary, Demcy, the contract to clean, remove asbestos from and demolish 110,000 sq.m of buildings; later that year, it entrusted a consortium of Eiffage Énergie Systèmes and Eiffage Génie Civil with Package 2B, relating to the 225 kV distribution station; and in March 2022, it awarded Eiffage Énergie Systèmes Package 2C for 20 kV/400 V low-voltage distribution.",https://www.eiffagegeniecivil.com/newsroom/news/eiffage-to-build-accs-first-electric-battery-gigafactory-in-douvrin-france-in-a-contract-worth-almost-75-million
