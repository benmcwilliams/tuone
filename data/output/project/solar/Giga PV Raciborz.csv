giga-pv.pl,,"GigaPV applied for a subsidy to the Innovation Fund

In March, GigaPV S.A. submitted an application to the EU Innovation Fund (InnoFund) program for the PhoTons project – Production of TOPCon photovoltaic cells in Poland as part of the European supply chain. In this way, the company has reached one of the milestones on the way to obtaining financing and launching the production of a new generation of photovoltaic cells with a capacity of 1 GW per year at the turn of 2025/2026. The gigafactory construction project has been in development for 2 years. The selection of technology and the development of directions for its improvement are carried out in cooperation with the Fraunhofer Institute. The actions taken so far allow not only to increase the efficiency of cells (25.5%), but above all to reduce the cost of metallization of contacts (electrodes). An important element of the activities carried out by the company is to ensure sources of financing, including the development of an appropriate path of public aid, for which the Institute of Renewable Energy – founder of GigaPV is responsible. In addition to attracting private investors, the company is seeking public funding. In particular, it concerns the so-called important projects of common interest (PV IPCEI), the National Recovery Plan (KPO) and the use of the latest support instruments for the PV industry. They include the EU’s proposals in the Regulation on Carbon-Neutral Industry (Net Zero-Industry Act) and the currently revised Temporary Framework for State Aid in Crisis Situations (TCTF) and the new State Aid Guidelines for Industry (GBER). As a result, it will be possible to support the EU PV industry with subsidies, tax reliefs and loans or guarantees, and level the playing field in competition with Asia and the United States. Obtaining and finalizing the financing for the construction of the cell factory, due to the significant initial costs exceeding EUR 86 million, is the key task of the GigaPV management board over the next 12-18 months. InnoFund is one of the funds offering subsidies for industrial investments, theoretically up to 60% of the CAPEX incurred for innovations aimed at reducing CO2 emissions. Among several criteria for evaluating applications, the most important is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. When preparing the PhoTons project for InnoFund, Giga PV took into account the minimization of the carbon footprint in the entire supply chain. As a future business partner, it gained support from both European suppliers of silicon wafers with the lowest carbon footprint as well as from key domestic and European manufacturers of PV modules (cell receivers) and suppliers of equipment for the production line. The prediction line will be installed in the existing industrial hall in Racibórz, which ensures low energy expenditure for construction. Approx. 15% of the factory’s electricity consumption will come from its own PV farm, and 50% of the cell production will be directed to the high-emission domestic energy market. As a result, in accordance with the InnoFund methodology for large projects (LSC-2022), the gigafactory will reduce CO2 emissions by 25.1 million tons over 10 years. An important element of the work on the application was talks with partners, obtaining offers from equipment suppliers and production line contractors, as well as expressions of interest from financing institutions, banks and private investors. InnoFund is a prestigious source of financing, especially important in the initial phase of the investment and – which is unique – also at the stage of ensuring the modernization of the line and the improvement of technology several years after the start of production. The subsidy can be a lever for other public and private sources of co-financing – notes Grzegorz Wiśniewski – CEO of GigaPV. He also emphasizes that the work on the application and the update of the feasibility study and business plan allowed for the expansion and consolidation of the team of experts, creating the engineering, scientific and managerial foundations of the future team. 305 people will be employed directly in production and control (full-time equivalents), and in addition, the factory will generate almost 1,300 indirect jobs in the supply chain, adds Wiśniewski. GigaPV thanks in particular European suppliers of silicon wafers and Polish producers of PV modules and the financial sector for their support of the application.",https://giga-pv.pl/news/

RIL to accelerate global collaborations for giga factories,,"Billionaire Mukesh Ambani is leaving no stone unturned in his quest to building Reliance giga factories. Reliance is accelerating global collaborations--especially in technologies to manufacture green hydrogen and storage battery and photovoltaic cells--before beginning construction of giga factories. Reliance New Energy Solar Ltd (RNESL), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Reliance Industries (RIL), plans to complete ₹60,000 crore investment by 2024 to build one of the largest integrated renewable energy manufacturing facilities in the world.

RIL is developing 5,000 acres of land in Jamnagar, Gujarat to build Dhirubhai Ambani Green Energy Giga Complex. It has two refineries and a petrochemical complex in the vicinity. The complex will have four giga factories -- an integrated solar photovoltaic module factory; an energy storage battery factory; an electrolyser factory for making green hydrogen; and a fuel cell factory for converting hydrogen into motive and stationary power.

In the third quarter result announcement, Ambani says that recent partnerships and investments in technology leaders in the solar and green energy space is illustrative of RIL's commitment to partner in the clean energy transition. ""We continue to pursue growth initiatives and collaborate with global leaders who share our vision of a sustainable future for our planet,"" he adds.

Bank of America Securities said in a recent report that RIL is focusing on creating most advanced and integrated new energy ecosystem supported by its recent acquisitions. RNESL acquired REC Solar ($771 million), Sterling Wilson (a 25% stake for $240 million), Faradion ($170 million) and NexWafe ($30 million). It signed cooperation agreement with Denmark-based Stiesdal A/S for technology development, and manufacturing of hydrogen electrolyzers in India. RNESL along with strategic investors Paulson & Co. Inc. and Bill Gates, and a few other investors, announced an investment of $144 million in Ambri Inc, an energy storage company based in Massachusetts, USA. The investments are precursor to rollout of giga factories.

Goldman Sachs estimates Reliance's new energy business EBITDA at $12.2-$16.8 billion in FY40. It is expected to be $3.6-$4.5 billion by FY30. For new energy business, solar will be the key driver this decade followed by batteries and hydrogen in the next decade, the report says.

The photovoltaic giga factory will convert raw silica to poly silicon and to ingot and wafers. The wafers will be used to make high efficiency solar cells and modules. According to Ambani, Reliance will establish at least 100 giga watt (GW) of solar energy by 2030. ""A significant part of this will come from rooftop solar and decentralised solar installations in villages,"" he says at the last annual general meeting. The company is exploring advanced electro chemical technologies for developing large-scale grid batteries to store the energy from the solar installations. RIL will collaborate with global majors for the battery technology.

The green hydrogen factory will be built essentially for promoting decarbonisation of sectors like transportation, power and other manufacturing. The fuel cell giga factory is expected to set the trend to replace internal combustion engines with non-polluting cells, which use oxygen from the air and hydrogen, to generate electricity. The only emission in the process is water vapour. Fuel cell engines can power automobiles, trucks and buses. They can also be used in stationary applications for powering data centres, telecom towers, emergency generators and micro grids and industrial equipment.

IIFL says that the solar photovoltaic business will witness a swift ramp up to 15GW global installations by FY25. Though RNESL is yet to make its strategy clear in segments such as hydrogen, battery backup and fuel cells.

RIL will also invest an additional ₹15,000 crore in value chain, partnerships and future technologies, including upstream and downstream industries.

""New energy will remain a key driver for RIL stock price in 2022 as RIL looks at technology acquisitions, and setting up of capacities in new energy,"" says JM Financial. RIL has also formed a new energy council with global experts for the project advisory. Ambani earlier stated that the company has technology specific start-ups in America, Europe, Australia and Asia on its radar for strategic partnerships or acquisitions.",https://www.fortuneindia.com/enterprise/ril-to-accelerate-global-collaborations-for-giga-factories/106897
