Belinus unveils shingle solar panels with 20.1% efficiency,2023-03-16 00:00:00,"Belinus has developed a new black shingle solar module for rooftop applications.

“We produce this series in low carbon footprint factories with reduced material consumption, where the metal interconnect ribbon is eliminated, the encapsulant and cell are thinner, the silicon content is reduced by 40%, and the module’s lead content is reduced by more than 60%,” a company spokesperson told pv magazine.

The Nova modules feature a nominal power rating of 420 W and a power conversion efficiency of 20.1%. The open-circuit voltage is 34.5 V and the short-circuit current is 12.2 A.

The new product measures 1,812 mm x 1,096 mm x 30 mm and weighs 20.8 kg. It has an operating temperature ranging from -40 C to 85 C, and an IP 68 enclosure. The maximum system voltage is 1,500 V. The company offers a 35-year power output guarantee for 86% of the initial yield.

The Belgian solar module supplier has also announced plans to build a 500 MW solar module factory at an unspecified location in Belgium.

“We are already in active negotiations with local government officials to start the production by the end of the first quarter of 2024,” the company said in a statement, adding that it also plans to build another module manufacturing facility in Georgia. “The total capacity will exceed 5 GW by the end of 2025.”

Belinus has factories in China and Vietnam with has a combined annual production capacity of 2.2 GW. However, it has yet to provide any details about the exact locations of the Asian facilities.",https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/03/16/belinus-unveils-new-shingle-solar-panels-with-20-1-efficiency/
Belinus: 5 GW PV module factories in Belgium and Georgia,2023-03-14 12:50:36+01:00,"The first phase of the 500 MW TopCon PV module production line will create 128 jobs locally in the solar energy field, and the second phase will be exceeding 1GW TBC line.

The new factory allows Belinus to tighten its distributorship network and presence not just around Europe but to target the US market too, the company announced. Belinus will continue its expansion drive with leading Tier1 manufacturers. Belinus has started in working with 2 out of the World’s Top 5 retained executive search firms for the Plant Manager and Group CEO positions to speed up the process of meeting the high demand needs of the targeted customers, the company stated.

Up to 22% efficiency

“The demand for Belinus products and solar solutions is even higher than expected and forecasted. we are already in active negotiations with local government officials to start the production by the end of the first quarter of 2024. In addition, we recently enforced our strength on the 35 years warranty insurance, and we will made the annoucement during InterSolar Europe in June” – says Francis Rome, the Chairman of Belinus.

It is worth highlighting that Belinus is well known as the only producer of ultra-black double-glass IBC PV modules. Recently the jury of Solar Solutions (Amsterdam) and Be Positive (Lyon) has chosen the product to be nominated as the innovation of 2023 in solar energy solutions categories. Thanks to its size, very high efficiency and long lifespan, the Belinus IBC ultra-black double-glass panel is a cost-effective product with up to 22% efficiency. (hcn)

Belinus to build 5GW TOPCon and TBC module manufacturing facilities in Belgium and Georgia,2023-03-13 17:06:34+00:00,"“We are already in active negotiations with local government officials to start the production by the end of the first quarter of 2024,” said Francis Rome, chairman of Belinus.

With the new facilities, the company expects to increase its supply chain in Europe as well as target the US market. The Belgian solar PV manufacturer currently has a 2.2GW annual capacity.

With Belinus’ 5GW annual manufacturing capacity of tandem and TOPCon technology, it would bring closer the European Commission’s goal of reaching 30GW of European manufacturing capacity by 2025 across the entire value chain.

Since the EC released its Green Deal Industrial Plan early in February, Europe has had an uptick in solar manufacturing projects with Exiom and Iberdrola partnering to bring a 500MW TOPCon facility in Spain later this year, French startup Carbon planning to build a 5GW and 3.5GW cell and module production facility respectively in France and German manufacturer AE Solar selecting Romania to build a 10GW solar module facility.

Belgian manufacturer unveils 400 W black glass-glass heterojunction solar module for residential applications,2022-08-29 00:00:00,"From pv magazine Global

Belgium-based PV module manufacturer Belinus has launched an ultra-black double-glass bifacial heterojunction solar module for residential applications.

“All solar cells and solar panels produced by Belinus are manufactured in Bloomberg Tier-1 factories with a combined annual capacity of 2,2 GW in Vietnam and Turkey,” a company’s spokesperson told pv magazine.

The M8 nLite Ultra Black Double Glass Module panel is based on 166 mm x 83 mm monocrystalline solar cells sourced in Thailand and 1.6mm thin double glass. “All our products rely on our proprietary heat-strengthened glass processing technology called nLite technology,” the spokesperson explained. “The use of thinner glass reduces the workloads of the installation compared to standard dual-glass products, while withstanding high wind and snow loads.”

The module features a nominal power of 400 W and a power conversion efficiency of 22.0%. The open-circuit voltage ranges from 44.7 V and the short-circuit current is 10.7 A.

The new product measures 1,755 mm x 1,038 mm x 30 mm and weighs 19.2 kg. It has a temperature coefficient of -0.25% per C, an operating temperature ranging from -40 C to 85 C, and an IP 68 enclosure. The maximum system voltage is 1,500 V.

“The guarantee for our glass-glass solar modules is 35 years reinsured by Lloyds group,” the spokesperson stated. “The module should be available in the fourth quarter via distribution partners across Europe.”

"Belinus to Construct 5GW Solar Module Facility In Belgium, Georgia",,"Belinus to Construct 5GW Solar Module Facility In Belgium, Georgia

Mar 15, 2023 10:35 AM ET

Belinus stated that the solar module factory will certainly be functional by the end of 2025.

The project will certainly be constructed in two phases to tab European as well as US markets.

Belinus, the Belgian solar manufacturer titan, will be constructing a 5GW solar PV module production center in Belgium and also Georgia. It said that the solar module manufacturing facility will certainly be functional by the end of 2025.

Belinus held that the solar module manufacturing facility will certainly be created in 2 phases. In the First Phase Belinus will develop a 500 MW manufacturing center for Tunnel Oxide Passivation Contact (TOPCon) module.

In the Second Phase, the Belgian company will be developing over 1 GW of Tandem Back Contact (TBC) solar cell innovation center.

Belinus intends to develop the new production facility with the purpose to increase the supply chain in Europe as well as likewise able to cater to the American markets.

""We are already in active arrangements with local government officials to start production by the end of the very first quarter of 2024,"" claimed Francis Roma, Chairman of Belinus. At present Belinus is having an annual capacity of more than 2.2 GW.

The European Commission is aiming to accomplish 30-GW of making capacity across the worth chain in the renewable resource segment by the center of this decade.

In 2015, Belinus released an ultra-black double-glass bifacial heterojunction solar module that would certainly be used in residential rooms. It was additionally granted as Leading PV Brand Name from EUPD Research which is a famous market research company based out of Bonn, Germany.

The vagaries of climate adjustment as well as the brazen financial influence of the Russian-Ukrainian dispute has forced Europe to increase its renewable energy market as well as solar production is basic part of it. The European Commission lately created Green Deal strategy. Exiom as well as Iberdrola are in collaboration to establish a 500MW TOPCon facility in Spain in 2023 itself. Carbon-- a French Renewable Energy business-- will build 5GW and 3.5 GW capacity of producing facilities. AE Solar will certainly be to building a 10GW solar module center in Romania.",https://list.solar/news/belinus-to-construct/
