Solitek to build 600 MW solar module factory in Italy,2023-03-20 00:00:00,"Solitek, a unit of ophthalmic lens maker Global BOD, has unveiled plans to build a solar module factory in southern Italy.

“The factory will be located in Benevento, in the region of Campania, and will have an annual capacity of 600 MW,” a company spokesperson told pv magazine, noting that the initial investment will reach €50 million ($53.4 million).

The Lithuanian solar module manufacturer said the facility will produce solar panels for applications in agrivoltaics.

“Italy's favorable climate for agriculture provides a suitable environment for agro-installations, a significant advantage compared to Northern Europe, where the window for agro-installation usage is relatively short,” said Solitek. “Operating a manufacturing plant in Southern Europe will also help Solitek avoid fluctuations in production capacity during winter when solar panels in Northern Europe cannot be used.”

The factory is expected to begin manufacturing in the second quarter of 2024. At an unspecified later stage, it will also make 1 GWh of residential battery capacity per year. “Throughout the gradual development of the new manufacturing facility and after its creation, Solitek plans to generate up to 300 jobs, revitalize a low-employment area, and attract further international and local investments.”

pv magazine print edition The current issue of pv magazine focuses on the solar manufacturing technology enabling the new era of market expansion and high efficiency modules, including interdigitated back contact (IBC) and perovskite tandem solar cells. The magazine charts the latest technical and investment decisions in the high efficiency solar manufacturing segment and the materials and R&D underpinning them. Reports come in from France, Japan, India, Indonesia, Israel, England, the US, and China and we also examine the troubles of the solar-powered car pioneers.

The company currently operates a 180 MW module factory in Lithuania. It recently unveiled a 40-cell solar panel for agrivoltaic applications with power conversion efficiencies of 12.6%. The module can operate with a maximum system voltage of 1,500 V. Solitek said it used the panels in a 1.5 MW agrivoltaic rooftop project in Malaysia.

Solitek invests 50 million Euro in new PV module factory,2023-03-22 10:30:03+01:00,"Solitek, a major solar panel manufacturer in Northern Europe, is expanding its operations into Italy and investing nearly 50 million euros in establishing a new solar module manufacturing plant in the country. The Lithuanian company's move is part of its long-term strategic plan to expand and establish a strong presence in the European market, paving the way for future growth and expansion into other regions. The project is expected to take three years and is financed through a combination of subsidies from the European Commission and Solitek's capital.

Julius Sakalauskas, the CEO of Solitek, postulates that the new plant in Italy represents an exciting development that will enable the company to take advantage of the growing demand for sustainable energy and help support the agricultural sector in Italy. Therefore, the enterprise’s plans to provide solar panels for agro-installations (AgroPV) that produce electricity, provide shade for plants and protect them against adverse weather conditions.

Stepping stone into Solitek’s expansion in Southern Europe

Overall, the novel manufacturing plant will also serve as a stepping stone for Solitek's expansion into Southern Europe. Italy's favorable climate for agriculture provides a suitable environment for agro-installations, a significant advantage compared to Northern Europe, where the window for agro-installation usage is relatively short. Operating a manufacturing plant in Southern Europe will also help Solitek avoid fluctuations in production capacity during winter when solar panels in Northern Europe cannot be used.

Stability in production and its impact on green energy production

Following a complex decision-making process of selecting prospective locations, the decision to invest in Italy was driven by two crucial factors: the favorable climate and the increasing demand for sustainable energy, specifically in the agricultural industry.

In all instances, Solitek is committed to providing solar panels for agro-installations (AgroPV)) to produce electricity, provide shade for plants, and protect them against adverse weather conditions. This initiative will help preserve agricultural land while providing clean energy for farming operations.

Furthermore, the new manufacturing plant is expected to impact the EU's efforts to incentivize the region's green energy production and economic recovery.

Uncovering the gradual project development

The project is expected to take three years, with Solitek planning to spend close to 50 million euros in developing and constructing the new facility. The corporation is currently organizing technical specifics, with plans to transition to the first development stage to build a 600 MWh solar panel production line in Q2, 2024.

In the second phase, Solitek will install a 1 GWh battery line for energy storage. The growing demand for sustainable energy production and changing consumer needs inspired Solitek to take their product line further, developing this innovative approach to storing energy. The new energy storage battery called Nova is designed to keep excess electricity during off-peak hours and discharge it when needed. Nova batteries use artificial intelligence (AI) to track weather and consumer behavior changes to optimize energy production and storage. The new line could revolutionize the sector, maximizing energy usage, lessening environmental effects, and reducing electricity prices by up to 50% for the end consumer. Storing electricity could also stabilize the electric grid and provide a reliable backup. Two years after the initiative's launch, the business intends to begin recycling lithium batteries to become more self-sufficient and comply with the EU rule prohibiting the transfer of raw materials to unauthorized persons.

Exploring the impact on employment and investment

Throughout the gradual development of the new manufacturing facility and after its creation, Solitek plans to generate up to 300 jobs, revitalize a low-employment area, and attract further international and local investments. (hcn)

Solitek to build 600MW solar PV module assembly plant in Italy,2023-03-27 12:48:13+00:00,"Solitek will make modules using tunnel oxide passivated contact (TOPCon) cell technology in the new plant, which is expected to be operational in the second quarter of 2024.

Solitek currently has two production plants in Lithuania, one for solar panels with an annual capacity of 250MW and one with an annual capacity of 200MWh for batteries.

With the expansion in Southern Europe, Italy was selected first for its favourable climate and secondly the country’s agricultural industry.

The new plant will specifically target the agrivoltaics (agriPV) market, which has seen a fair amount of development in Italy with its most recent project from renewable energy group Enel Green Power which started construction on a 170MW agriPV project, the largest in the country according to the Italian company.

Moreover, the Italian Ministry of Agricultural, Food and Forestry Policies (Mipaaf) launched in August 2022 a €1.5 billion scheme to incentivise agriPV projects across the country with a target to add 375MW of solar PV capacity, while energy giant Statkraft partnered with Italian universities to explore the potential of the technology in Europe.

A second phase is expected to add a battery line with 1GW of annual capacity for energy storage, called Nova. The new energy storage battery will use artificial intelligence to track weather and consumer behaviour changes to optimise energy production and storage.

This new module assembly plant is expected to create up to 300 jobs in the region.

Since the beginning of the year, Europe has seen an increased activity in module assembly plant announcements after the EU revealed its Green Deal Industrial Plan aimed at boosting domestic manufacturing activity for the solar industry.

Several manufacturing projects have been announced across the continent in the past couple of months, with a partnership between Spanish utility Iberdrola and manufacturer Exiom for a 500MW annual capacity TOPCon plant in Spain later this year, French PV manufacturing startup Carbon plans to build a 5GW/3.5GW cell and module plant, respectively in the South of France, German manufacturer AE Solar plans to build a 10GW module assembly plant in Romania and Belgium solar manufacturer Belinus selected Belgium and Georgia to build 5GW of TOPCon and TOPCon Back Contact module assembly plants by the end of 2025.
