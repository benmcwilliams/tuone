The investor plans to donate 100 kW of solar panels to local authorities every year

According to Paunov, the investor plans to donate 100 kW of solar panels to the local authorities every year, and to secure additional benefits to citizens. Technical documentation for solar panels for all public buildings will be funded and prepared by the investor.

An incubator for solar energy start-ups will be created and free training organized for solar panel installers. Every citizen of the municipality interested to install PV panels will be offered interest-free lease, Paunov said.

The factory in Bulgaria is one of three planned in the Balkans by AE Solar Horizon, which is established in 2022. The other two will be located in Greece and North Macedonia, according to a press release by investment fund New Vision.

AE Solar Horizon plans to build three factories in the Balkans

AE Solar Horizon has obtained its initial capital of EUR 3.5 million from Bulgarian venture capital fund New Vision 3, which provided EUR 1 million, German solar producer AE Solar GmbH, which contributed EUR 2 million, and Bulgarian engineering company ELIA, with EUR 500,000.

In September 2022 German company AE Solar announced an investment in North Macedonia.

A year earlier it also announced an investment near the Bulgarian city of Plovdiv, and a project in Kayseri, Turkey.

Italian company EXE Solar said in November that it would build a solar panel factory in Yambol in Bulgaria.",https://balkangreenenergynews.com/ae-solar-horizon-to-produce-solar-panels-in-bulgaria/
AE Solar Horizon to build solar panel plant in North Macedonia first,2023-01-30 00:00:00,"At the end of 2021 it emerged that one of Europe's big solar panel producers, Germany's AE Solar, was going to build a plant in Bulgaria. A year later however it turns out that this country has lost the competition for the project to a neighbor, North Macedonia. It is there that AE Solar Horizon, a company registered in Sofia as a German-Bulgarian partnership, will set up the production facility. The country was preferred for the incentives offered by Skopje, as well as the faster administrative procedures. The company will invest 50 million euro in the plant, which will manufacture 1.5 GWp of panels a year.

The good news is that Bulgaria is still in the plans - for a second factory. AE Solar Horizon is also considering a third facility, in Greece.

Partners

On the Bulgarian side, the project is run by Ilko Yotsev, manager and owner of several companies for water saving and energy efficiency solutions. He says he has been working for years with a professor from North Macedonia, Ilia Nasov, on the development of various solar panel technologies. The latest such project is a photovoltaic thermal (PVT) hybrid system that generates electricity and heat and is highly efficient. It is for the production of such panels that they have attracted AE Solar as a technology partner.",https://kinsights.capital.bg/business/2023/01/30/4443964_ae_solar_horizon_to_build_solar_panel_plant_in_north/

This Startup Grabs €3.5M to secure the Balkans’ Energy Independence with Solar PVs,2022-10-10 12:51:47+00:00,"The newly established Bulgarian company that produces Tier-1 photovoltaic (PV) panels, AE Solar Horizon, attracts a €3.5M investment from the local VC fund New Vision 3 (€1M), the German solar industry leader AE Solar GmbH (€2M), and the Bulgarian engineering company ELIA (€500K).

Founded by the energy specialists Ilko Yotzev and Evgeni Stefanov, AE Solar Horizon plans to build 3 innovative photovoltaic plants, in order to provide a long-term solution for a more environmentally-friendly way of energy supply.

The photovoltaic production plants will be located in Bulgaria, North Macedonia, and Greece, and will have the capacity to produce over 3 GWp of solar panels.

“Seeing how the market is developing and what actions different players are taking, we decided to start working on a project that can help to have a cleaner planet. Realizing all governments rely on solar power to conduct the green transformation, we decided to help our region, and Europe, by developing factories in the Balkans”, Ilko Yotzev, co-founder of Bulgaria solar energy startup AE Solar Horizon explains in a press release.

AE Solar Horizon is the second venture of Ilko Yotzev and Evgeni Stefanov. In 2013 the two of them founded Water and Energy Savings to improve the quality and affordability of energy supply. New Vision 3 participates in the 2020 €800K seed round of Water and Energy Savings. Prior to his career as a founder, Yotzev worked in EBRD and Siemens and served as the Deputy Energy Minister of Bulgaria between 2002-2005.

Now, setting on a mission to solve the regional energy crisis in a sustainable manner, the two co-founders are taking on the opportunity to manufacture PV panels that produce both electric and heating energy.

“The €3.5M investment in the company is a good start. In the months to come, our aim is to raise additional funds, reaching €100M by the end of next year. A further step will be an IPO, as we are already in talks with different European stock exchanges”, Ilko Yotzev highlights.

The untapped PV potential of Bulgaria

A country with a high potential for solar irradiation, Bulgaria started its renewable energy expansion fairly late. In 2007, the first hydropower installations came to life, and then solar power installations started in 2009 and reached a total of 100 Megawatts (MW) in 2011. Since then, however, the capacity hasn’t increased by a lot. In order to encourage more private actors to revive the Bulgarian solar sector after years of halt, lawmakers are making amendments to the Bulgarian Energy Act to reintroduce feed-in–tariff payments for rooftop PVs.

From a macroeconomic view, the prices of natural gas and electricity have skyrocketed in the past few months due to the war in Ukraine. This highlights the need for more diversified and sustainable ways of generating energy on a regional level. The use of renewable energy sources like the sun is part of the solution, and solar panels play a big role. Their supply, however, is scarce because of the higher demand from governments and businesses and the broken supply chains.

The goal of the Bulgarian solar energy startup, AE Solar Horizon, is to eliminate this obstacle in the solar panel supply chain. When working at full speed, their panels would produce 4TWh of energy every year in the region, which can save up to €1B per year for governments and businesses.

Roadmap of AE Solar Horizon

For the next 12 months to come, AE Solar Horizon will aim to start the construction of the plant in Bulgaria, to have its first factory installed and operating in Tetovo, North Macedonia, and to have selected the location for the Greek factory as well.

The latest financing would fuel the initial development efforts of the company. Alongside development activities, AE Solar Horizon will be looking to partner with universities in close proximity to the plants to help students gain the needed practical experience in these fields.",https://therecursive.com/this-startup-grabs-e3-5m-to-secure-the-balkans-energy-independence-with-solar-pvs/
AE Solar Horizon Grabs €3.5M to Support the Energy Independence of the Balkans,2022-10-10 10:35:46.350000+00:00,"







AE Solar Horizon is a newly established company planning to build 3 innovative plants to produce Tier-1 photovoltaic (PV) panels in the Balkans. These panels provide a long-term solution for a more environment-friendly way of energy supply. The initial capital of €3.5M is provided by the Bulgarian VC fund New Vision 3 with €1M, German solar industry leader AE Solar GmbH with €2M, Bulgarian engineering company ELIA with €500K, and energy specialists Ilko Yotzev and Evgeni Stefanov, the company’s executives and co-founders.





The panels to be manufactured in the plants are of the latest generation and are one of the first of their kind, including ones that can produce both electric and heating energy. They have higher productivity and better heat resistance.





As AE Solar Horizon is seeking regional impact, the company is planning to build 3 photovoltaic production plants in Bulgaria, North Macedonia, and Greece. The factories will have the capacity to produce over 3 GWp of solar panels. Working at full speed, panels will produce 4TWh of energy every year in the region. Due to the lower cost of renewable energy, implementing such panels can save up to €1B per year for governments and businesses.





A look into AE Solar Horizon’s roadmap for the next 12 months shows three main goals on the development side. By September 2023, the company expects the construction of the plant in Bulgaria to be in progress and to have its first factory installed and operating in Tetovo, North Macedonia. The location for the Greek factory should be selected by that time as well.





“To fulfill those goals, we needed strong partners, so we started talking to some of the global leaders. After a few meetings with AE Solar GmbH, we realized they’re right for us - a Bloomberg Tier 1 German manufacturer with more than 15 years of experience in the solar industry, operating factories in 3 other countries. The same was the case for ELIA, an engineering company specialized in the energy power industry, and more than a decade of experience in those types of projects,” Ilko Yotzev, co-founder of AE Solar Horizon, explains about selecting its partners.





Tackling the energy crisis in a sustainable way





Natural gas and electricity prices have skyrocketed in the past few months due to the war in Ukraine and other factors. This shows the need, especially in Europe, to find a more sustainable way of generating energy. The EU is pushing forward the Green Deal agenda and more and more companies are following decarbonization practices in an effort to accelerate the transition to alternative sources of energy. One of the key steps is the use of renewable energy sources like the sun. But a component, missing in this transition, is solar panels, whose supply is scarce due to the higher demand from governments and businesses and the broken supply chains.





“Seeing how the market is developing and what actions different players are taking, we decided to start working on a project that can help to have a cleaner planet. Realizing all governments rely on solar power to conduct the green transformation, we decided to help our region, and Europe, by developing factories in the Balkans”, Ilko Yotzev, co-founder of AE Solar Horizon explains.





Yotzev highlights that the idea behind AE Solar Horizon is to provide a solution to support the energy independence of the whole region and do it in a sustainable way. The solar panel plants will be powered by renewable energy sources.





Expansion lies ahead





“The €3.5M investment in the company is a good start. In the months to come, our aim is to raise additional funds, reaching €100M by the end of next year. A further step will be an IPO, as we are already in talks with different European stock exchanges”, Ilko Yotzev explains.





Besides the financing, the development of these plants also requires a large amount of human capital, such as experts and engineers. AE Solar Horizon aims to partner with universities in close proximity to the plants to help students gain the needed practical experience in these fields.





Playing the role of a catalyst for building a sustainable Bulgarian economy is another aspect of the development of AE Solar Horizon.
