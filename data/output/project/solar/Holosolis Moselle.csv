Heraeus buys stake in French solar manufacturer HoloSolis,2023-11-09,"From pv magazine France

German silver metallization paste maker Heraeus has acquired an unspecified stake in French PV module manufacturer HoloSolis.

In 2025, HoloSolis plans to open a PV cell and panel factory in Hambach, France. At full capacity from 2027, the factory is expected to employ 1,700 people and produce 10 million modules per year, for a total capacity of 5 GW per year.

“Heraeus, with its cutting-edge metallization technologies, is a very valuable asset for our global leadership,” said HoloSolis President Jan Jacob Boom-Wichers.

In fiscal 2022, Heraeus achieved sales of €29.1 billion ($31.1 billion) with around 17,200 employees in 40 countries.

“Heraeus will also play an active role within the board of directors, providing its advice, experience and expertise,” said Christian Neumann, a tech specialist for Heraeus.

Germany’s Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy (ISE) recently said that it will support HoloSolis in setting up its planned manufacturing facility.

Three European entities – EIT Innoenergy, French IDEC Group, and TSE – founded HoloSolis. EIT Innoenergy is an EU-financed clean-tech investor based in Eindhoven, the Netherlands. IDEC Group is a real estate developer in France, while TSE is a key producer of solar energy in France and a leader in agrivoltaics.

Germany’s Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy (ISE) said it will support French startup Holosolis, a spinoff of EIT InnoEnergy, in building a module manufacturing facility in Hambach, near Sarreguemines, in northwestern France.

The site is at a now-abandoned factory project by REC. The Norwegian solar module manufacturer originally planned to build a 4 GW heterojunction panel factory there.

“HoloSolis' approach of building a PV production line from solar cells to PV modules while further developing the technology convinced us from the beginning,” said Jochen Rentsch, head of technology transfer in the photovoltaics division at Fraunhofer ISE. “We are very happy to be able to accompany the young company on its way to become a major European-based producer of PV components.”

"Holosolis – PV made in Europe, by Europeans for Europeans.",,"We are committed to manufacturing the most energy efficient modules using the latest photovoltaic technologies, with the lowest carbon footprint and highest social standards. Our state-of-the-art 5GWp factory will start production in 2025. Our production will contribute towards achieve the European Union’s stated goal of manufacturing 40 GW in Europe by 2030. We will produce 10 million PV panels per year equivalent to the energy needs of 1 million homes.

Holosolis will accelerate innovation across the entire photovoltaic value chain, from raw materials to recycling. Our products are designed for the following markets:",https://holosolis.com/
"Holosolis, backed by EIT InnoEnergy, launches Europe’s largest solar PV gigafactory to bolster EU energy security",,"The factory will start production in 2025 and, at full capacity will have a production capacity of 5GW per year, producing 10 million photovoltaic modules annually, equivalent to the energy needs of one million European homes. Committed to supporting local talent, it will also employ 1,700 people, most of which will be recruited in the Grand Est region and the Sarreguemine area, supported by a partnership with Pôle Emploi.

At a time where energy security is high on the agenda, Holosolis is committed to increasing Europe’s solar manufacturing capacity. With China currently responsible for 80% of the world’s installed photovoltaic modules – compared to 3% for the European Union – Holosolis answers directly to growing concerns about supply sovereignty. Holosolis also puts sustainability at the core of its industrial project, aiming to lead the EU industry towards low-carbon, recyclable products.

Holosolis was created by three leading players in their respective markets. First, EIT InnoEnergy, supported by the European Union, one of the largest investors in cleantech and sustainable energy. EIT InnoEnergy has brought on board the IDEC Group, a major player in the French real estate industry and TSE, one of the main producers of solar energy in France, leader in agrivoltaics.",https://www.innoenergy.com/news-events/holosolis-launches-europes-largest-solar-pv-gigafactory-to-bolster-eu-energy-security/
