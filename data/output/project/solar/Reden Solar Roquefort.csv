Reden to deploy 200 MW solar module manufacturing line,2023-04-26 00:00:00,"From pv magazine France

French solar developer Reden Solar has announced that it will invest €4 million ($4.4 million) to deploy a new solar module production line at its headquarters in Roquefort, France.

Reden plans to start manufacturing activities at a new line by the end of the year. It will have an annual capacity of 200 MW. The company currently operates a 65 MW line in Roquefort, which has been producing modules since its inception in 2009. According to Thierry Carcel, CEO of Reden, the old line will remain active for small panel series and after-sales service.

Carcel stated that producing their own panels brings several advantages, including ensuring independence and avoiding dependence on large manufacturers for small series of 30 or 40 MW. Reden's expertise in the downstream business is also an advantage for the solar module production itself, as it helps in designing profitability plans for their projects eligible for the French tenders for PV or projects linked to PPAs.

Although the new modules produced by the company may be up to 8% more expensive than their Asian counterparts, Carcel believes that customers are ready to pay more for “Made in France”, reduced carbon content, and excellent performance. He cited a recent power purchase agreement (PPA) that Reden secured from French railway operator SNCF, where the SNCF agreed to pay a little more for panels produced in France.

Macquarie-led consortium acquires Reden Solar,2022-03-07 00:00:00,"A consortium led by Australian financial group Macquarie Asset Management has agreed to acquire French solar developer Reden Solar from French infrastructure companies Infravia and Eurazeo. Reden told pv magazine in October that its sale process “was under way,” with France's TotalEnergies bidding on it along with Macquarie.

The Macquarie consortium, which also includes Canada-based investment firm British Columbia Investment Management Corporation (BCI) and Germany's MEAG Munich Ergo Assetmanagement GmbH, has invested €2.5 billion in the transaction, which is scheduled to be completed in the third quarter of 2022.

Reden Solar, with offices in France and Spain, develops, finances, builds and operates solar photovoltaic power plants in Europe and Latin America with an installed portfolio of 762MW and a portfolio under development of 15GW. France and Spain are its main markets, and it has recently expanded its presence in Greece and Italy.

Macquarie Asset Management's stake in Reden Solar will be purchased on behalf of institutional investors through the Macquarie Global Infrastructure Fund and the Macquarie Green Investment Group Renewable Energy Fund 2 (Mgref2, which raised €1.6 billion at closing in February 2021). Reden Solar is the fourth investment for Mgref2, having recently completed the acquisition of Apex Energies Group, in France.

REDEN Solar enters the Portuguese market with the acquisition of 50 MW of Solar plants in operation,2019-05-20 12:11:28+02:00,"REDEN Solar, which already has a strong presence in France and Latin America, has chosen to continue its European development in Portugal, due to favorable economic prospects and the country's strong commitment to renewable energies. Thanks to the continued support of successive governments in recent years, renewable energy now accounts for 68% of the country's energy mix, making Portugal one of the countries with the highest renewable energy penetration worldwide.

This commitment to green energy is confirmed by the stated objective of the current Government to reach 80% of renewable energy in the energy mix thanks to the development of photovoltaic energy.

Thierry Carcel, President of REDEN Solar said: “This transaction marks a key milestone in the deployment of the new strategy launched by our Group a year ago with the arrival of two new key shareholders, INFRAVIA and EURAZEO Patrimoine. Our objective is to invest to develop our activities in France and around the world by fully exploiting the Group's potential. The choice of Portugal is also part of the ambitious approach taken by the State in the promotion and development of the renewable energy sector. Its commitments are now turned into action and their continued implementation plays a key role in investor confidence. Where, following the 2008 crisis, other countries have retroactively challenged their tariffs and caused the long-term departure of investors, the Portuguese government has managed to cope with the extremely difficult economic situation, hence his current credibility. ” REDEN Solar is celebrating its 10th anniversary this year, including a year of solid collaboration with its new shareholders, INFRAVIA and EURAZEO Patrimoine. The group is deployed in France and abroad as a pure player by covering and controlling the entire value chain; from development to the holding and operation of solar power plants. The facilities developed to date by REDEN Solar represent a cumulative capacity of 330 MW, including 180 MW under its direct ownership. The company is involved in numerous projects at various stages of development or construction representing more than 350 MW, and the company's ambition is to continue to significantly increase its production capacity in the coming years.",https://www.pv-magazine.com/press-releases/reden-solar-enters-the-portuguese-market-with-the-acquisition-of-50-mw-of-solar-plants-in-operation-2/
