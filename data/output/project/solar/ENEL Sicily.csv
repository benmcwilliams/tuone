Enel, Italy to challenge China on solar panels, cut dependency

CATANIA, Italy, Dec 5 (Reuters) - At the foot of Mount Etna in Sicily's ancient city of Catania, utility Enel has begun work on a giant factory with the ambition of helping to end China's dominance of the solar market and to galvanise Italy's under-developed south.

The project to expand the capacity of Enel's (ENEI.MI) 3Sun plant 15-fold is especially relevant as the European Union seeks to speed up the switch to renewables and end its dependence on Russian gas.

It also has support from Italy's Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, who took charge in October, and has pledged to boost renewables in the south to try to tackle decades of under-development.

So far the practical help for a project that will create around 1,000 jobs, has come from the Europe Union.

It has given 188 million euros ($197.5 million) of the total investment of 600 million euros, with Enel (ENEI.MI) providing the rest after Enel Green Power, the utility's renewable arm, decided to expand its Sicilian plant in January.

The company says Chinese production is likely to be cheaper, though it aims to close the gap. It also says its panels are better and that 3Sun will be the European Union's largest producer of high performance bifacial solar panels by 2024.

With the help of a new solar cell structure developed by Enel Green Power, the double-sided panels will be able to capture sunlight on two surfaces, and convert 30% of the sunlight that hits it into power compared with an average efficiency of around 20%.

""Our panels cost a little more, but have higher efficiency, a longer average life and a much lower degradation than Chinese technologies,"" Eliano Russo, the head of 3Sun in Catania, said.

The decision to base the project on an island on the southern tip of Europe was made, he said, because Enel had already developed expertise there.

""We have people who grew up here, some came back for this job and they are hugely motivated to show Sicily, for once, can be a place where something new arises,"" he told Reuters.

SICILY IS NOT ALONE

Analysts say factories such as Enel's are crucial to reducing Europe's reliance on Beijing and ensuring Europe's ambitions to increase its use of solar energy do not make it even more dependent.

Eurostat figures show around three quarters of Europe's solar panels are sourced from China.

Germany - for which the Ukraine crisis that exposed its over-dependence on Russian gas is a harsh lesson in the need for diverse supplies - is seeking to revive its solar industry that collapsed a decade ago after government subsidies to the sector ended.

The European Union as a whole aims to reach almost 600 gigawatts (GW) of solar energy by 2030 and the number of installations is increasing. Industry group SolarPower Europe estimates panels that would generate at least 40 GW have been installed this year and that growth will exceed 270 GW by 2025.

Russo says Europe needs to reach annual solar panel production capacity of 20 GW in the next three years if it is to avoid over-dependence on China.

The Sicilian plant's current production capacity of around 200 megawatts (MW) per year will rise to 3 GW by July 2024.

Enel is not limiting its ambitions to Europe, although it says at least 50% of its Sicilian production will be for the continent.

It will build a similar facility in the United States, as part of a broader initiative to expand its manufacturing capacity and benefit from tax credits granted under the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act.

It also sees Latin America as one of the most promising new markets for its panels.

CHINESE COMPETITION

So far, China is not manufacturing in Italy.

Chinese President Xi Jinping in 2019 visited the Sicilian capital of Palermo when Italy was the first industrialised nation to be considered as part of Beijing's Belt and Road Initiative for trade.

Subsequent Italian governments have been less open to China, including the current one.

China's embassy in Rome had no immediate response to a request for comment.

Giorgio Cuscito, China analyst at geopolitical review Limes, said China had favoured Sicily as ""a strategic location in the middle of the Mediterranean and opposite Africa, where Beijing has important business and geostrategic interests"".

He said the importance of Enel's factory and other similar ventures was in part to ward off projects, such as Chinese ones.

""Alternatives, such as the new gigafactory, should be provided to persuade people and companies in southern Italy to reject any future proposals which might be dangerous for the national interest,"" Cuscito said.

Italian Energy and Environment Minister Gilberto Pichetto Fratin also said China's dominance needed to be checked and did not rule out public support for Italian solar projects provided it complied with European Union rules on state aid.

""The benefits cannot all be foreign, in this case essentially Chinese,"" he told Reuters. ""It is a major industrial segment and we should aim at least for European self-sufficiency.""

Enel to build Europe’s biggest solar PV factory in Sicily,,"On the island of Sicily, at one of Europe’s southernmost points, plans are underway to bring the solar supply chain to the continent’s shores.

Italian energy company Enel announced in April last year that, with grants from the EU and Italian government, it will invest €600m to expand its existing solar photovoltaic (PV) panels production facility in Catania, increasing capacity 15-fold from 200 megawatts (MW) to three gigawatts (GW) by 2024. It will produce high-performance bifacial PV modules — panels that can capture sunlight on both sides — and is expected to achieve a capacity of 400MW by September this year.

Sicilian scale-up

Eliano Russo, head of Enel Green Power’s 3Sun facility in Catania, tells fDi “Sicily is not the first location you would think of for a project like this, in terms of infrastructure and logistics”.

But, he explains, the company now has an established presence on the island and the intention was always to scale up operations once new technology was in place. “The idea was that after we proved that our technology was competitive and had potential, we could start leveraging economies of scale.”

Established on the island in 2010, the company’s facility has been producing modules since 2018. There are also plans underway to invest in a similar facility in the US, but Mr Russo could not confirm where exactly.

The decision to expand the plant was taken in January last year, before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which sent European gas prices soaring and gave the EU added incentive to accelerate the green transition by weaning the bloc of Russian fossil fuels.

The expansion has received funding from both the EU and Italian government, amounting to a combined sum of €188m, or a little under a third of the total investment. The project is slated to add some 1900 direct and indirect jobs to the local economy. Enel hired 50 people over the course of the past year and expects to hire 700 more at 3Sun in 2023, according to Mr Russo.

Model to follow

Slated to be the biggest solar module plant in Europe, 3Sun is positioning itself as a model to follow for Europe, even in these early days. But with more than 80% of solar PV panel manufacturing currently taking place in China, are these European ambitions to reshore the supply chain too little, too late?

“If we want to avoid being completely dependent, we need to act now. Yes, we’re late, but the [green transition] is a marathon; it’s not something that we decide upon today and the problem will be solved within two years.” he says.

“This is a marathon we have to run together,” Mr Russo adds. “3Sun alone is not able to change the manufacturing industry in Europe, but it can be an example to follow and this is our ambition as we join forces with other partners.”

Before getting carried away with the broader significance of such a project and its hypothetical impact, there are practical considerations that anchor 3Sun into the Sicilian ground: its focus remains its bottom line and energy needs.

Although at least 40% of the panels are to be produced and sold in Europe, as per the EU funding requirements, Enel’s facility is still a profit-seeking enterprise.

“The mission of the factory is to produce panels ... in a profitable way. So, of course, our mission will be to extract the maximum value out of this production.”

There are also not enough renewable energy developers locally to meet all the plant’s energy requirements through green means, Mr Russo adds. Of the plant’s current base load demand, roughly a third of its energy supply comes from gas.

“Unfortunately, the most efficient way to get the energy we need is by burning gas,” he says. “We are studying greener options, such as green hydrogen, but, in my view, on a 10-year horizon to preserve the competitiveness of the factory, this will likely remain the case.”",https://www.fdiintelligence.com/content/feature/enel-to-build-europes-biggest-solar-pv-factory-in-sicily-81951
Italy expands Europe’s first solar ‘gigafactory’,2023-02-07 12:07:31,"Italy’s energy utility Enel inaugurated its expanded 3Sun solar panel manufacturing facility in Sicily, making it the biggest factory in Europe, officials said.

Located in Catania, the 3Sun factory is already one of the largest solar panel production plants in Europe and the first of its kind in Europe to mass produce panels that capture the sun’s energy from both sides.

The solar panel factory, which currently has a production capacity of around 200 megawatts per year, plans to expand its production of photovoltaic panels to achieve 3 gigawatts by July 2024, Enel says.

“With 3Sun, we are practically demonstrating that in Italy, and therefore also in Europe, thanks to innovative technology, we can now produce state-of-the-art photovoltaic panels that are competitive in international markets,” said Enel CEO Francesco Starace.

“Initiatives like this are what the future of energy will be built upon,” he added, stressing that Europe needs to invest in its domestic supply chain to increase its energy security.

At the facility, Enel will produce double-sided photovoltaic modules allowing the panel to capture sunlight from both sides. The technology increases the efficiency of PV cells to 30% while current technology has an efficiency of around 20%, the company says.

The total investment for the facility’s upgrade amounts to around €600 million, including €188 million through grants received from the European Commission via the EU’s pandemic recovery fund and innovation fund.

Europe’s ambition is to decrease dependence on China, which dominates global PV production.

Italy invests in clean energy to become European energy hub The government is investing in clean energy, in addition to gas and LNG, to become energy independent and become the energy hub of Europe.

Italy bets on renewables

The new gigafactory is part of Italy’s plan to “become the energy hub of Europe,” said Gilberto Pichetto Fratin, the Italian environment and energy minister who spoke at the plant’s inauguration on Monday (6 February).

According to Fratin, southern Italy is becoming central to Europe’s energy supply, both as a source of wind and solar power and as a gateway to receive gas supplies from the African continent.

The gigafactory is also expected to have a significant local impact, with the creation of around 1,000 jobs, and more indirect ones, according to Enel.

“The regional government has already defined a strategy that focuses on green energy sources and is working hard to accompany this transition,” explained Renato Schifani, President of the Sicily region.

Modules produced at the factory will be sold throughout Europe, but the goal is to increase also domestic renewable energy production and to use them in Sicily and in the rest of Italy, Schifani explained.

Italy currently relies on fossil fuels, mainly gas and oil, for about two-thirds of its energy mix, while renewables cover only one-third of the nation’s energy sources.

The government’s goal is to overturn this proportion, Fratin said, and to produce two-thirds of Italy’s energy from renewable sources in order to ensure greater energy security, with gas supplying the remainder.

The government envisages for instance major investments in the development of agrovoltaics, which uses agricultural land to place solar panels, with the aim of installing 1.04 GW of agrovoltaic plants.

EU renewables strategy

The European Commission was also represented at the factory’s inauguration event, with the participation of Ditte Juul Jørgensen, its director-general for energy.

Brussels gave a strong boost to renewables last year in the wake of Russia’s military aggression in Ukraine, Jørgensen said. This included a dedicated solar energy strategy aiming to double installed photovoltaic capacity by 2025, with a legal obligation to install solar panels on every new building.

This was followed by new fast-track permitting rules for renewables as well as a new solar industry alliance aiming “to create the right market conditions, so that our manufacturing sector remains competitive and brings jobs and growth to Europe,” she added.

Jørgensen also expressed concern about international competition, referring to the recent US Inflation Reduction Act. “Our response in Europe is our European Green Deal industrial plan, a plan to make Europe the home of pure tech and industrial innovation on the road to net zero,” she said.

EU Commission launches industry alliance for 'made in Europe' solar PV The European Commission on Friday (9 December) officially launched the EU’s solar photovoltaic industry alliance, with the aim of regaining production lost to China and establish a “Made in Europe” industry.

Enel to create 3-GW solar factory in Italy with EU backing,,"The renewables arm of Italian utility Enel SpA (BIT:ENEL) today said its 3Sun solar panel factory in Catania, Sicily, will become a 3-GW-per-year facility after signing a grant agreement with the European Commission (EC).

The so-called TANGO (iTaliAN pv Giga factOry) project is one of seven large-scale climate transition projects that will get EUR 1.1 billion (USD 1.2bn) in grants via the EU Innovation Fund, which is funded by revenues from the EU's Emissions Trading System (ETS).

Enel Green Power said its project will create Europe’s largest factory producing high-performance bifacial photovoltaic (PV) modules. It represents a EUR-600-million investment, including almost EUR 118 million from the EU’s Innovation Fund. This will see the annual capacity of the 3Sun factory expanded from the current 200 MW to 3 GW by July 2024. An initial portion of 400 MW is planned to be online in September 2023.

The investment comes amid accelerated global demand for PV modules and a supply chain that is currently excessively dependent on a single Asian source, commented Enel Group chief executive Francesco Starace.

“This investment will place 3,000 MW per year of production capacity back in Europe and will mark for Italy a big step in retaining leadership in technology,” Starace said, adding that the project will contribute to the EU's objective of 40% energy consumption from renewables by 2030 and to reducing energy dependency.

According to the announcement, the factory’s production will include bifacial heterojunction (B-HJT) PV cells that will be further developed to also incorporate a tandem cell structure, which would allow PV modules to exceed 30% efficiency.

Enel shows progress on Europe’s largest solar panel factory,2023-02-08 13:45:41+00:00,"Enel shows progress on Europe’s largest solar panel factory Business news | February 8, 2023 By Nick Flaherty



Italian energy firm Enel is showing the progress of its 3Sun solar panel manufacturing plant in Catania, Sicily.

Enel says the €600m expansion of the plant will create Europe’s largest solar panel factory when it opens in 2024, with an annual production capacity of 3 GW. This compares to 1.2GW planned for Meyer Burger’s plants in Germany this year and 300MW at SolarWatt in Dresden. Both German suppliers are also expanding their production lines to meet demand across Europe.

The gigafactory expansion in Catania will increase the factory’s current annual production capacity of 200 MW to about 3 GW per year by initially developing photovoltaic modules using silicon heterojunction technology (HJT).

The plant will then move to producing tandem panels that combine silicon HJT cells with perovskite cells on top for higher overall conversion efficiency. Meyer Burger is also planning to move to commercial tandem panels.

Enel is reported to be in talks to sell a stake in the plant.

The expansion began in April 2022 and is expected to be completed by 2024. It will consist of two stages: an operational capacity of 400 MW will be available from September 2023, while full operational capacity will be reached by July 2024. Tandem photovoltaic modules, on the other hand, will be produced starting from late 2025.

The iTaliAN Giga factory (TANGO) project is one of seven initiatives selected by the EU Commission as part of the first Innovation Fund call for large-scale projects, and was awarded funding worth up to 118 million euros.

Enel Chairman Michele Crisostomo, Enel CEO Francesco Starace, the Italian Minister of the Environment and Energy Security Gilberto Pichetto Fratin, the Director-General for Energy of the European Commission Ditte Juul Jørgensen, the President of the Region of Sicily Renato Schifani, and the Catania Municipality’s Special Commissioner – Prefect Piero Mattei visited the construction site this week.

“Renewable energy growth estimates for the next few years make a clear case for investing in the creation of a domestic production chain, which represents a strategic move for Italy and Europe, in order to balance demands for energy security and independence with the demands of the economy, of the employment market and of the environment,” said Francesco Starace, CEO and General Manager at Enel.

“With 3Sun, we are practically demonstrating that in Italy, and therefore also in Europe, thanks to an innovative technology, we can now produce state-of-the-art photovoltaic panels that are competitive in international markets. Initiatives like this are what the future of energy will be built upon.”

This state-of-the-art research is the key technological driver for a country that has decided to become Europe’s energy hub,” said Gilberto Pichetto Fratin, Minister of the Environment and Energy Security.

“This investment has strong political significance, which is that of liberating our country from foreign dependency, especially from China, also when it comes to producing renewable energy systems,” he added.

“Such independence is achieved through quality and innovation, through the ability to produce better, higher performing and more durable elements that are more easily disposed of and recycled. Production at the Gigafactory is also in line with the Government’s commitment to increasingly and decisively install renewable energy plants, up to at least 8 to 10 GW per year.”

Ditte Juul Jørgensen, Director-General for Energy of the European Commission, said: “Europe’s clean energy transition materializes through projects like this one. It will allow to tap into the immense potential for renewable energy sources deployment the area of Catania harbors, turning Sicily into a European leader in solar power production with high added technological value, and opening an international corridor for clean energy that not only Italy, but the entire European Union can benefit from. It is a major opportunity to strengthen skilled workforce, spur investment in the grid and increase Europe’s energy independence in line with the REPowerEU plan.”
