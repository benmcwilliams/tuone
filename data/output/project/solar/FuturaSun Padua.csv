FuturaSun announces new 2 GW solar module factory in Italy,2023-03-09,"FuturaSun has announced plans to build a 2 GW solar module factory in Cittadella, Veneto, Italy. It said it will initially invest €25 million ($26.4 million) in the new factory. It has already secured 24,000 square meters of land for the factory.

The company said the new facility will produce high-efficiency solar panels, without providing further technical details. It currently manufactures n-type interdigitated back-contacted (IBC) modules, as well as PERC panels and heterojunction (HJT) products.

“The project fits into the company's strategic industrial plan, and it follows through on the European mission of rebuilding the European supply chain, with FuturaSun taking the role of one of the main players,” said FuturaSun CEO Alessandro Barin.

The company is based in Cittadella, in Italy's Padua province, and operates two solar modules factories totaling 1 GW in China. Its Italian staff focus on R&D in areas such as interdigitated back-contact (IBC) cells, cylindrical ribbons, glass-glass solutions and modules with independent sections.

The new factory, when constructed, will become the second gigawatt-scale PV module manufacturing facility in Italy. A 3 GW facility is currently being constructed by the Italian utility Enel in Sicily, southern Italy. This facility is expected to begin commercial operations this year. The company is betting on n-type HTJ cells with an efficiency of 25.5%. It said this could result in module efficiencies above 24%",https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/03/09/futurasun-announces-new-2-gw-solar-module-factory-in-italy/

FuturaSun relaunches the European photovoltaic supply chain with a new center dedicated to the development and production of PV modules



PADUA, Italy, March 09, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- FuturaSun, the leading Italian manufacturer of high-efficiency photovoltaic panels, has acquired a 24,000 sqm plot of land in the industrial area of Cittadella (Padua) to establish a new Italian Gigafactory. The facility will reach a 2 GW/year production capacity of high-efficiency photovoltaic modules, manufactured using the most innovative technologies.

With this important step, the company commits to a total investment of 25 million Euros over the next few years.

The project fits into the company's strategic industrial plan, and it follows through on the European mission of rebuilding the European supply chain, with FuturaSun taking the role of one of the main players.

Alessandro Barin, the CEO of FuturaSun, declares, ""With this new industrial hub, we believe we can enhance our hometown while also becoming a reference point in the HORIZON IBC4EU project*, a program within the REpowerEU plan and the European Green Deal to revive the Italian and European photovoltaic industrial supply chain in support of continental energy transition strategies.""

The new HQ will be designed according to across-the-board environmental and sustainability criteria and will include an R&D center for applied scientific research, a large test-field for product control and improvement, a PV Academy and a training center to recreate the expertise of industry professionals.

FuturaSun was founded in Cittadella in 2008 and has successfully transformed the 2012 photovoltaic crisis into an opportunity. After 15 years of uninterrupted growth, with a Gigafactory already active in China and two others under construction, the company continues in its project to reposition the supply chain, initiating another dream of reviving the Italian district of photovoltaics in Veneto.
