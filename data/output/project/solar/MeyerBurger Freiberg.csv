Meyer Burger production plant opening in Freiberg,,"A lot has happened since Meyer Burger announced in August last year that it would reactivate the Freiberg solar site. In the factory hall as well as in the logistics center in the Saxonia Industrial Park, months were spent rebuilding and setting up, assembling, researching and testing. The plant is still the largest for the production of solar modules in Europe - now with state-of-the-art technology for the manufacture of highly efficient SmartWire modules. The first products destined for sale are scheduled to roll off the production line in Freiberg in July. The heterojunction solar cells used for this purpose will soon come from the Meyer Burger cell plant opened last week in Thalheim (City of Bitterfeld-Wolfen). The set up of industrial production in the photovoltaics sector, together with the associated value chain, will not only create new prospects but also numerous jobs in the region.

Top-class panel discussion

What kind of perspectives the renaissance of the solar industry means for Saxony and the energy turnaround in Germany and Europe will be the topic of the high-profile discussion panel taking place on the occasion of the site opening in Freiberg. On the panel around moderator Kristina zur Mühlen will be Michael Kretschmer (CDU), Prime Minister of Saxony, as well as Wolfram Günther (Bündnis 90/Die Grünen) and Stephan Lowis, CEO of envia-M. Walburga Hemetsberger, CEO of Solar Power Europe, is connected via screen from Brussels. In addition, Udo Engelhardt, an extremely entertaining climate impact researcher, who already presented interesting facts and figures at the plant opening in Thalheim, will be a guest.

The talk session at the plant opening in Freiberg will be broadcast live on YouTube and Facebook between 1.45 and 2.45 pm. Questions on the topic can be put directly to the panelists via the chat.",https://www.meyerburger.com/en/opening-freiberg
"2 GW Meyer Burger solar cell factory in Colorado, hints of more coming",2023-07-24,"Meyer Burger will construct a 2 GW per year solar cell manufacturing facility in Colorado Springs, Colorado. The facility will be used to exclusively produce solar cells to feed the company’s Goodyear, Arizona solar module manufacturing facility.

The company also stated further expansion in the U.S. was probable. CEO Gunter Erfurt said, ”Meyer Burger is currently working on additional multi-gigawatt offtake agreements in the U.S. with new customers. We are already exploring opportunities to add further solar cell and module production capacity in the country”.

The two cities, separated by a mountain range, are a bit over 800 miles and twelve hours away. Colorado Springs is just over an hour away from the National Renewable Energy Lab in Golden, Colorado.

The manufacturer noted multiple sources of financing for the facility.

First of course, is that solar cells made in the factory are expected to qualify for the advanced manufacturing tax credit 45X, which is part of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). Meyer Burger says that from the end of 2024 through 2032, the company’s current manufacturing capacity at its solar cell and module factories would manufacture a cumulative sum of hardware that would be eligible for up to $1.4 billion in tax credits.

As part of the IRA, solar cells manufactured in the U.S. earn 4¢/Wdc in tax credits, while solar modules earn 7¢/Wdc in tax credits, totalling 11¢/Wdc for Meyer Burger’s hardware. At 2 GW/year for eight years (including all of 2025 through the end of 2032), a minimum of 16 GW of modules would be manufactured at the facilities.

The company noted additional funding of $90 million was provided from the city of Colorado Springs and the state of Colorado, mainly in the form of tax credits, direct support and discounted electricity and water rates. Meyer Burger said $300 million in prepayments from module offtake partners, as well as funding from the Department of Energy loan program total $300 million.

The prepayments from module offtake partners include funding to cover the operating costs of the facility, purchase price of the components that go into the modules (wafers, glass, aluminum, etc), as well as a floating price on the wafers, which protects both parties in the transaction against the volatile polysilicon market.

The company said the machines used to make the solar cells will be redirected from current plans of deploying this hardware in Germany. This was done to get the U.S. manufacturing facility up and running as fast as possible. The company was recently awarded $224 million by the European Union to develop 3.5 GW of solar cell and panel manufacturing.

Meyer Burger had previously said it was considering solar cell manufacturing in the U.S. after the Internal Revenue Service released their “domestic content” guidance on May 12 – about two and a half months ago. The guidance made clear that in order for a solar module to meet domestic content guidelines and partially qualify a project for the 10% tax credit adder, that the solar cells in the solar modules must be made in the U.S.

The company’s Arizona facility recently announced new solar module offtake agreements that have brought its annual manufacturing capacity goals to 2.0 GW/year as well. Meyer Burger’s module offtake partners include D. E. Shaw Renewable Investments, Ikea, and BayWa r.e..

Meyer Burger has also hinted that there are light talks with residential installation companies Sunrun and Sunnova, however, no other deals are announced at this time. Sunrun & Sunnova, which are primarily residential solar companies, are able to make use of the 10% tax credit adder for domestic content in the residential space – unlike actual homeowners. This is because the commercial and residential tax credits are separate laws within the Inflation Reduction Act, and the residential tax credit doesn’t offer a domestic tax credit bonus.

Thus, these two companies – and any other third party residential asset owner – have a strong business interest to sign an offtake deal for the residential module manufacturing lines in the Arizona Goodyear facility. Currently, these manufacturing lines have no signed offtake agreements in place.",https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/07/24/2-gw-meyer-burger-solar-cell-factory-in-colorado-hints-of-more-coming/
Meyer Burger to develop 400 MW high-performance solar module manufacturing facility in the U.S.,,"Favorable market conditions, growth opportunities, and policy support for the solar industry informed Meyer Burger's decision to establish a production site in the United States

Initial production is expected to be 400 megawatts (MW) of annual nominal capacity by the end of 2022, with the potential for multiple gigawatts expansion in the future

At full capacity, the facility will provide hundreds of skilled manufacturing jobs

Discussions with U.S. states are ongoing, and the final site selection is expected by year-end 2021

Procurement of all machinery and equipment for the U.S. plant is taking place in parallel with final site selection to enable rapid scale-up of production

Meyer Burger Technology AG announced today that the company plans to establish a production site for high-performance solar modules in the United States. This investment is in line with Meyer Burger's commitments to produce modules near end-customers, source material from regional suppliers, and improve overall sustainability by reducing transportation emissions and optimizing the carbon footprint of the company's solar modules. This approach also reduces supply chain delays and provides flexibility and resilience for Meyer Burger's customers.

The company is currently in discussions with several U.S. states to determine the final site location. A decision is expected by year-end 2021. The decision to continue to expand the company's solar energy supply chain to the U.S. is supported by a strong domestic solar market, positive economic policy conditions, and Meyer Burger's desire to support the U.S. clean energy transition. The initial production capacity will be 400 MW - with potential for further growth to multiple gigawatts capacity - and will include capabilities to manufacture solar modules for residential, commercial/industrial rooftop, and utility-scale applications. Production is expected to be operational by the end of 2022, and, at full capacity, the new facility is expected to employ hundreds of skilled manufacturing workers.

""Meyer Burger is thrilled to be expanding our production footprint to the U.S.', said CEO Gunter Erfurt. 'The United States has a rich history in the solar industry. The world's first photovoltaic production facility was established in California in the 1970s - well ahead of Europe and Asia. Now it is time to return to the industry's roots and help end dependency on offshore imports. Our proprietary Heterojunction cell technology and patented SmartWire module technology enable us to produce the highest quality and highest performance products for economically competitive solar energy for our customers.""

Meyer Burger is considering a shortlist of several U.S. states for the company's facility. Key criteria for site selection include existing facilities, regulatory, and tax frameworks, state and local economic development programs, available skilled workforce capacity, proximity to transportation infrastructure, renewable power supply, and local community commitment.

Ardes Johnson, President of Meyer Burger Americas, added: 'With this strategic expansion, Meyer Burger will produce the world's premier solar panels right here in the U.S., unlocking access to clean energy consumers crave. We are encouraged by bipartisan support for domestic manufacturing of solar infrastructure to secure true energy independence and control of our future. It is critical for the U.S. to develop its domestic supply chain and de-risk itself from heavy dependence on Asia. We are excited to contribute to this important goal and are ready to tackle the rapidly increasing demand for clean energy.'
