Silfab Solar and NorSun sign deal to expand solar cell and module production in the US,2023-09-08 14:25:33+00:00,"Silfab is aiming to add 1GW of cell production capacity, plus 1.3GW of module production capacity, by the middle of next year. NorSun, meanwhile, is looking to build a 5GW ingot and wafer production facility in the US, and all of these projects could be crucial steps in building a functional US solar supply chain.

“We are very pleased to enter into this agreement with Silfab and share the long-term ambition to build a competitive western PV value chain,” said NorSun CEO Erik Løkke-Øwre. “The agreement with potential significant volumes fits well with our strategy to enter the U.S. market and to expand the NorSun production capacity.”

The deal follows considerable investments made into the US solar sector by both companies. In 2021, Silfab opened its second production facility, in Washington state, which increased its US production capacity to 800MW, and the company plans to begin commercial operation at a third project, which will have a module capacity of 1.2GW, next year.

Similarly, NorSun increased its total production capacity to 1GW in 2019 following the completion of a NOK230 million (US$21.6 million) funding round, and both companies are now keen to expand their capacity further in the US.

New additions to the US solar supply chain have been considerably encouraged by the passing of last year’s Inflation Reduction Act, which has encouraged companies to develop solar manufacturing capacity in the US so the US solar sector can reduce its reliance on imports from China. While some have suggested that many of the benefits will be more acutely felt from 2024 onwards, Silfab and NorSun’s announcement is an important demonstration of the growing interest in US solar development.

The news also follows the publication of an encouraging report from the Solar Energy Industries Association and Wood Mackenzie, in which the authors expect the US solar sector to add 32GW of new capacity in 2023, which would be the most in a single year in history.",https://www.pv-tech.org/silfab-solar-and-norsun-sign-deal-to-expand-solar-cell-and-module-production-in-the-us/
Netherlands selects 2.2 GW of PV projects in new SDE++ round,2022-11-25 00:00:00,"The Dutch Ministry of Ministry of Economic Affairs has revealed that it has preselected 2.26 GW of PV projects in the 2022 round of the SDE++ (Stimulering Duurzame Energieproductie) program for large-scale solar and renewable energy projects. Solar accounts for around 90 % of the assigned capacity thus far.

Rijksdienst voor Ondernemend Nederland (RVO), the state-run agency that manages the SDE++ program, has accepted 2,052 renewable energy project proposals with a combined capacity of 2,344 MW. Of these projects, 1,944 were for rooftop PV installations with a combined capacity of 1,275 MW, while 77 were for 955 MW of ground-mounted solar capacity. Another 20 were for 20 MW of floating solar arrays, in addition to 75 MW of wind farm proposals.

“Developers could apply for a maximum of 37.5 TWh of renewable electricity generation on land for solar PV and wind in this round,” said the RVO. “This production ceiling has not been reached.”

The budget for the 2022 SDE++ program is €13 billion ($13.5 billion), which is the highest amount for the scheme to date. The program also accepted renewables-linked green hydrogen proposals for the first time, as well as industrial electrification projects based on hybrid glass furnaces. In addition, there were three proposals to build 42 MW of hydrogen electrolyzers.

In the latest round of the program, the Dutch government selected 3,426 PV projects with a combined capacity of 3,535 MW. The Netherlands could reach between 38 GW and 125 GW of total installed solar capacity by 2050, according to a new report by Netbeheer Nederland. By the end of December, the country’s cumulative installed solar capacity hit 14.3 GW.",https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/11/25/netherlands-selects-2-2-gw-of-pv-projects-in-new-sde-round/
Swedish solar firm Midsummer has closed talks for An EU innovation grant,2023-12-06 05:52:02+00:00,"Highlights : The EU grant will enable Midsummer to build a thin film cells solar manufacturing facility in Sweden.

Swedish solar firm Midsummer has moved closer to a solar cell manufacturing facility in Sweden, with the closure of talks with the EU on the grant the firm is to get. The new mega-factory for the production of thin film solar cells in Sweden by Midsummer is now a step closer with the talks finalized and both parties having signed the agreement. The EU grant is half of the counter-financing needed, or a third of the project cost.

In July the EU Innovation Fund announced that it had selected the Swedish manufacturer of solar cells Midsummer for funding of EUR 32.3 million for a new solar cell factory in Sweden with the capacity to produce 200 MW solar cells annually.

After negotiations on the conditions for the grant, Midsummer and the EU Innovation Fund have now signed the grant agreement which, among other things, regulates the timetable for the construction, dates for payments of the grant, counter-financing, etc.

The objective of the project is to build a factory in Sweden for the production of 200 MW of thin film solar cells annually, which together with the factory that Midsummer is completing in Italy would give the group an annual production capacity of 250 MW of solar cells. (Completion and start of production of the Italian factory is completely independent of the support from the EU Innovation Fund.)

Start of production for the new Swedish factory is planned for the first quarter of 2026. Before that, during 2025, installation of equipment, test production for functionality tests, certification of the factory and training of personnel will take place. The factory which would provide around 250 jobs.

The project follows the timeline and scope as previously communicated. Before the first grant payment can take place, the project as a whole must have its financing secured. The grant from the EU Innovation Fund corresponds to approximately 50 percent of the counter-financing that is required for the grant to be awarded. Midsummer is now looking at options for the counter-financing which may include a combination of capital, loans and other public financing. Midsummer’s long-term goal is to expand its total production to over 1 GW by 2030.

The EU innovation fund is one of the world’s largest financing programs for innovative technology that contributes to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The grant is provided specifically for the construction of a factory in Sweden for the manufacture of Midsummer’s proprietary CIGS thin film solar cells which are thin, light, flexible and with an ultra-low climate footprint. They are particularly suitable for installation on the many roofs around Europe that cannot withstand the weight of traditional silicon solar panels, as well as for the increasing number of organizations that strive for climate neutrality in their operations.",https://www.saurenergy.com/solar-energy-news/midsummer-and-the-eu-sign-agreement-on-grant-for-new-swedish-solar-cell-factory
Dutch government invests up to €412 million in solar power in latest funding round,2023-07-03 12:45:14+00:00,"The project will build three solar technologies in the Netherlands, silicon heterojunction cells, flexible perovskite foils and “solar PV products” for use in buildings and vehicles.

The National Growth Fund is an ongoing initiative from the Dutch government to invest in projects that “ensure the sustainable earning capacity of the Netherlands,” according to the government. The fund will contribute a minimum of €135 million to the project, plus an additional €177 million should the project meet particular conditions, and one of the stakeholders behind SolarNL can apply for a separate loan from the government of €100 million.

In SolarNL’s own budgeting, it estimated that it would receive €312 million from the fund, enough to cover 35% of its total budget, with the remainder sourced from private investors. Should the project deliver on all of its objectives, the National Growth Fund will cover its entire expenses, so the stakeholders will be eager to ensure that SolarNL lives up to expectations.

The National Growth Fund has committed considerable funds to Dutch infrastructure projects in general, and energy supply initiatives in particular. In this round of funding, the government has invested €4 billion into 18 projects, part of the fund’s plan to invest €20 billion between 2021 and 2025, and the fund backed projects involving the circular development of batteries and a proposal for subsidised charging stations.

Indeed, subsidy funding is a new aspect of this year’s funding round, with projects able to apply for direct government funding for the first time. Two projects applied for direct subsidies, the charging hub project, which asked for €44 million, and a green steel proposal, which asked for €124 million, as the Dutch government looks to invest in energy infrastructure across the industry.

The funding round is the latest commitment to solar power in the Netherlands. The government expects the country’s solar capacity to jump from 18GWp in 2022 to between 100-250GWp by 2050, and stakeholders are looking beyond conventional solar modules to meet these goals.

Last month, figures at offshore classification group DNV announced that the Netherlands was seeking to invest in floating solar power, with an initial 5MW project, which could be followed by a 100MW project.",https://www.pv-tech.org/dutch-government-invests-up-to-e412-million-in-solar-power-in-latest-funding-round/
Europe's solar dash quickens prospect of new cell technologies,2022-12-15 00:00:00,"Summary Accelerated renewable energy targets and soaring energy costs could see faster rollout of higher efficiency solar technologies, if funding risks can be dampened.

December 15 - A surge of investment in European and U.S. solar manufacturing capacity in the coming years will see new technologies gain a foothold in the market.

Europe and the U.S. must accelerate solar and wind deployment to meet ambitious renewable energy targets. Both regions are looking to triple solar manufacturing capacity by 2025 and expand further by the end of the decade to bolster energy security. Europe and the U.S. currently host around 8 GW of module manufacturing capacity, just one third of annual solar installations, making developers highly dependent on Asian suppliers.

Tax incentives in President Biden's inflation reduction act (IRA) are set to spur new U.S. facilities and European manufacturers are calling for more help to scale up production and manage soaring energy costs.

Global module supply is currently dominated by established monocrystalline silicon wafer technology but interest in new higher performance HJT (Heterojunction) and TOPCon (Tunnel Oxide Passivated Contact) technologies is growing and perovskite materials will play a major role, Karl Melkonyan, Senior Analyst, Solar and Clean Energy Technology at analysts S&P Global, told Reuters Events.

The European Union is implementing legislation to accelerate solar and wind build and wider funding support will provide a pathway towards commercial-scale manufacturing of new technologies.

The EU has reopened bids for its Innovation Fund mechanism that will provide 25 billion euros ($26.2 billion) of support over 2020-2030 for innovative low-carbon technologies. On December 9, Brussels launched the Solar PV Industry Alliance to identify investment needs and coordinate funding mechanisms.

To spur commercial deployment, the European Parliament has drafted an amendment to the Renewable Energy Directive (RED III) passed in September that requires next-generation technologies including PV materials to comprise at least 5% of new renewable energy capacity. A 5% share for innovative solar technologies would equate to tens of gigawatts of installed capacity this decade.

This legislation would “speed up the commercialisation of new, high-quality, European-made renewable energy technology,” the Association of European Renewable Energy Research Centers (EUREC) said.

Technology battle

Modules using established monocrystalline silicon wafers represented around 84% of the 190 GW of global PV production capacity in 2021, according to consultants 1-Tech.

HJT combines crystalline silicon and amorphous thin silicon film in three layers while TOPCon makes commonly used PERC cells more efficient by adding an ultra-thin oxide top layer. HJT currently has a global market share of just 2.5% but REC Group, a solar panel manufacturer headquartered in Singapore, expects a compound annual growth rate for HJT manufacturing of 70% over 2021-26. REC Group first commercially developed its Alpha HJT technology in 2019 and the company plans to build a 2 GW HJT module factory in France using funding from the EU Innovation Fund.

Developers are also combining technologies to optimise designs and HJT is likely to succeed as a tandem technology alongside layers of perovskite cells, Melkonyan said. Perovskites are materials with a crystal structure resembling the perovskite mineral. They have strong light absorption and electric charge carrying properties and technology developers are raising conversion efficiencies to kickstart commercial deployment.

In one example, the EU-funded TRIUMPH consortium is developing modules with perovskites for middle and top cells and silicon for bottom cells. The research team includes developers such as Hanwha and Q Cells and a variety of research institutions, such as Germany's Fraunhofer ISE.

Melkonyan predicts perovskite technology will make an impact in the medium to long term, in single junction thin-film technology as well as ""various tandem solutions, such as crystalline-silicon with perovskite.""

Commercial barriers

Europe established itself as an early leader in solar innovation but Asia now dominates the commercial manufacturing space. Around 80% of global solar manufacturing capacity is located in Asia, mainly in China.

Funding is available for research activities in Europe but there is a lack of funding available to scale up activities, at a regional, national or European level, Philippe Mace, Head of Strategy & Analytics at consultancy the Becquerel Institute, told Reuters Events.

“Private investors and banks are more risk averse than in other regions of the world, while public authorities are reluctant to intervene, especially as European [market] regulation is very strict in terms of direct public support”, said Mace.

New technologies will offer higher solar efficiency but a lack of a proven long-term durability in the field increases risks, making it harder to attract investment and elevating the cost of funding large-scale facilities.

Some companies are capitalising on new national initiatives as countries scramble to accelerate renewables. Last month, Voltec Solar and Paris-based solar research group IPVF announced plans for a ""giga-factory"" to manufacture Tandem 4T Perovskite/Silicon modules. The technology increases energy output while reducing energy consumption and the partners have applied for funding for a pilot line through a French tender for innovative energy solutions. The factory could start producing panels in 2025, IPVF said.

Meanwhile, in China companies including GCL, Microqanta and Utmolight are already developing pilot manufacturing capacities for tandem cells in the range of 100 MW per year.

Energy problem

Any technologies that reduce energy consumption during manufacturing would give suppliers an advantage. Electricity and gas costs have soared since Russia invaded Ukraine and European manufacturers are calling for more support from the EU.

Energy costs in Europe are two to three times higher than in the U.S., “making overall solar PV manufacturing costs some of the highest in the world,"" Dries Acke, policy director of industry association SolarPower Europe, told Reuters Events last month.

Market analysts Rystad Energy recently warned that high power prices could see 35 GW/year of planned European PV manufacturing projects suspended. Polysilicon, ingot and wafer production is particularly energy intensive and Europe must rapidly expand ingot and wafer capacity.

In this context, new high-efficiency technologies with lower energy and materials consumption would ""truly reduce the manufacturing cost (per watt) as well as the electricity cost (kWh) for end users,"" Melkonyan said.

Mountain Iron solar plant's $10 million upgrade will create 130 new jobs,2023-12-05 23:23:11.672000,"MOUNTAIN IRON — An Iron Range solar panel manufacturing facility is adding another 130 jobs.

Ontario-based Heliene Inc. said a $10 million upgrade to one of its Mountain Iron production lines will double the line’s annual output to 300 megawatts. The plant, which opened in 2018, has expanded several times, and this summer, the company announced it had chosen the Twin Cities area as home to its second solar panel manufacturing facility in the state.

Business FROM 2021: Mountain Iron solar plant expanding A $12 million public funding package will help the city of Mountain Iron build Heliene, Inc. a new plant next to its existing facilty.

“Recent funding and federal incentives are helping us grow our facilities and workforce to keep up with historically high demand for domestically produced solar PV modules,” Heliene CEO Martin Pochtaruk said in a news release Tuesday.

In August, community solar provider Nexamp agreed to purchase 1.5 gigawatts of modules from Heliene, which said it was the largest community solar order in U.S. history.

Solar in the U.S. has seen an average growth rate of 24% over the last decade, according to a report by the Solar Energy Industries Association.
