NexWafe Secures €30M to Break Ground on First Commercial-Scale Green Solar Wafer Plant,,"Investment comes ahead of a larger funding round planned for later this year

FREIBURG, GERMANY, May 31, 2023 – NexWafe GmbH (NexWafe) today announced it secured €30M to accelerate the construction of its first commercial-scale facility in Bitterfeld, Germany to fabricate the company’s green solar wafers. The funds come from NexWafe’s current group of investors, including Reliance New Energy Limited, Aramco Ventures and ATHOS Venture GmbH, as well as new investors, including the Honorable Malcolm Turnbull AC and Keshik Capital, led by Alex Turnbull. NexWafe anticipates raising additional funding in the second half of this year.

Davor Sutija, CEO of NexWafe, commented: “This investment marks the start of NexWafe’s plan to raise substantially larger funds in the second half of 2023. The funds will be used to break ground on NexWafe’s first commercial facility to speed the renewable energy transition with more efficient, lower cost, green solar wafers for the world’s photovoltaic manufacturers.”

In parallel, NexWafe has agreed to work with Aramco Ventures on a future green solar wafer manufacturing facility in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The collaborative agreement will include participation from the firm’s $1.5 billion Sustainability fund.

NexWafe’s unique, patented green solar wafer manufacturing solution simplifies polysilicon production and reduces energy use and production time. This results in drastically lowered production costs for n-type monocrystalline wafers used for the majority of high-performing solar modules. The company’s novel manufacturing method delivers wafers that are engineered to the requirements of each customer and already achieving parity with commercially available Czochralski (CZ) wafers. Providing an opportunity to optimize the performance a chosen cell design enables solar cell makers to ultimately deliver higher efficiencies.

NexWafe’s process supports urgent U.S. and European efforts to re-shore domestic solar wafer manufacturing and cell production by increasing supply-chain sourcing diversity and resilience. The NexWafe process also reduces CO2 emissions, resulting in a solar-energy supply chain that is genuinely green.

NexWafe Groundbreaking in Bitterfeld Signals Return of Upstream PV Supply Chain to Germany,,"During a groundbreaking ceremony in Bitterfeld-Wolfen, NexWafe welcomed and celebrated with 130 attendees, including the Chief Mayor of Bitterfeld-Wolden, prospective customers, and key suppliers and equipment partners. More than 40 NexWafe team members also attended to celebrate the milestone achieved as a company.

NexWafe thanked Chemie Park Bitterfeld for their local support as both investor and infrastructure provider, as well as Group-IPS in Belgium for the engineering work, and BremerBau for the first phase of construction on the epitaxy facility.

The goal is to begin production for NexWafe's first commercial facility in the second half of 2025, based on completion of a contemplated Series D fundraising in the first half of 2024. This financing will also support a US expansion and further R&D.

More specifically, NexWafe is building an initial 250 MW production line in Bitterfeld-Wolfen and will invest at least €70 million at the site and create approximately 90 jobs. However, the existing infrastructure in the Bitterfeld-Wolfen Chemical Park enables NexWafe to build up 3 GW/a of additional wafer production capacity. The investment amount for the 3 GW/a expansion stage would amount to around 300 million euros and create up to 500 jobs in the Bitterfeld-Wolfen area.",https://www.nexwafe.com/news/nexwafe-groundbreaking-in-bitterfeld-signals-return-of-upstream-pv-supply-chain-to-germany
