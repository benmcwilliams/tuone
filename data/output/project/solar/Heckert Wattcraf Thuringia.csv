German consortium plans 5 GW vertically integrated solar module production,2023-08-21 00:00:00,"From pv magazine Germany

German solar module maker Heckert Solar, PV product distributor Wattkraft and Europe’s largest solar glass manufacturer Intefloat have unveiled a plan to build a vertically-integrated solar module production across several locations in Germany.

The consortium said it will invest around €2 billion ($2.18 billion) in the manufacturing facilities.

Thanks to this new investment, Heckert Solar's existing manufacturing plant in Langenwetzendorf, Thuringia, will see its capacity increase from 400 MW to 2.8 GW. Furthermore, the consortium will build a 5 GW facility to produce polysilicon and solar cells at a facility owned by Heckert Solar in Frankfurt am Oder, eastern Germany.

Moreover, Interfloat is planning to produce antimony-free, low-iron, textured solar glass for the combined value-added chain at one of its industrial sites in Brandenburg.

The consortium also said the new production facilities will manufacture glass-glass modules with an efficiency of 24% and a carbon footprint below 18 grams/kWh, which it says complies with the highest ESG sustainability standards.

German consortium to invest €2 billion in vertically integrated PV manufacturing after BMWK EoI,2023-08-21 11:35:00+00:00,"With the goal to reach a vertically integrated solar manufacturing capacity in Germany, the €2 billion investment will be made within 24 months and across three locations in the country. The first of these projects will be the expansion of module production in Langenwetzendorf, Thuringia, to reach an annual capacity of 2.8GW. In Frankfurt, existing facilities will be modified to produce solar cells, polysilicon and wafers with each a 5GW of annual capacity, while in Brandenburg a solar glass manufacturing capacity will be built to cater for the combined value chain, according to Heckert Solar.

The consortium aims to cover at least 90% of Germany’s added value in module and cell development, while reducing global dependency.

The companies have not yet disclosed which technology would be used, only that the PV modules will be glass-glass and have an efficiency of 24% based on new cell technologies, which is in itself the minimum percentage of module efficiency required by the BMWK’s EoI. PV Tech contacted Heckert Solar seeking more information on that matter.

Since the BMWK launched its EoI, several companies have declared interest in it, including US cadmium telluride thin-film module manufacturer First Solar and Switzerland-headquartered module manufacturer Meyer Burger which has currently delayed its solar manufacturing expansion in Germany, in favour of a US expansion to build a 2GW cell production in Colorado.",https://www.pv-tech.org/german-consortium-to-invest-e2-billion-in-vertically-integrated-pv-manufacturing-after-bmwk-eoi/
Consortium to invest EUR 2bn in solar module production in Germany,,"Three companies in the German photovoltaic industry are joining forces in a EUR-2-billion (USD 2.18bn) investment initiative to rebuild an integrated value chain for solar module production in Europe's largest economy.

Hanover-based inverters and solar modules distributor Wattkraft Systems GmbH & Co. KG, manufacturer Heckert Solar GmbH, and solar glass supplier Interfloat Corporation have submitted a joint project as part of an expression of interest call by the federal economy ministry that will support projects for large-scale solar manufacturing plants.

The planned investment amount will be used within 24 months to build and expand manufacturing capacity at three locations in Germany.

The project involves the expansion of an existing production site and the addition of an additional facility in Langenwetzendorf, Thuringia, where module production capacity should be raised to 2.8 GW annually. At the Frankfurt (Oder) location, existing buildings will be modified to house 5 GW of solar cell production annually, and a polysilicon production including wafer production with a capacity of 5 GW per year will be established. In Brandenburg, the partners plan to set up the world's first antimony-free, low-iron, textured solar glass for the combined value chain.

The three consortium partners aim to cover at least 90% of the value creation in Germany in order to have more influence on module and cell development and to achieve greater independence from global suppliers.

Swiss manufacturer Meyer Burger Technology AG, which has operations in Germany, also participated in the project call by proposing the construction of a 5-GW solar cell and module production facility. However, the company has temporarily halted its European expansion plans due to perceived unfair competition. Instead, it has redirected its attention towards the US market. In the first half, Chinese suppliers flooded the market in Europe with solar modules priced significantly below their production costs. This situation presents significant difficulties for domestic manufacturers.

Heckert Solar inaugurates 400 MW solar panel factory in Germany,2021-09-30 00:00:00,"From pv magazine Germany

German manufacturer Heckert Solar has commissioned its 400 MW panel factory in Langenwetzendorf, in the eastern German region of Thuringia.

The manufacturing facility will produce the company's new module series NeMo 3.0 120 M. The manufacturer invested a total of €21 million in its construction. The production equipment comes from Teamtechnik, 3D-Micromac and Ecoprogetti.

The first production line is already in operation and extends over 8,000m2 of the 24,000m2 production hall. The new plant is more automated than the 400 MW factory that Heckert Solar operates at its headquarters in Chemnitz, eastern Germany.

In the future, production will be carried out in four shifts in Thuringia. After the ramp-up of the new production facility, Heckert Solar will have an annual production capacity of 800 MW and employ 275 people.",https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/09/30/heckert-solar-inaugurates-400-mw-solar-panel-factory-in-germany/
