Exe Solar изгражда завод за 13 млн. лв. в Ямбол,2022-11-17 11:22:52+02:00,"Италианският консорциум Exe Solar започва изграждането на завод за производство на фотоволтаични модули в Ямбол. Инвестицията е в размер на 13 млн. лв. Според плана на компанията строителството ще стартира през април, а заводът се очаква да заработи до края на следващата година.

Предстои разкриването на 50 нови работни места за инженери и IT специалисти. За наемането на кадрите ще се търси сътрудничество с базирания в Ямбол факултет „Техника и технологии“ към Тракийския университет – Стара Загора.

Заводът ще се намира в местността „Рибарника“, където компанията е закупила 11 дка терен частна собственост за около 200 хил. евро. Съоръжението ще бъде със застроена площ около 3 дка.

Компанията от години произвежда в Китай и създаването на тази нова производствена линия за тях ще бъде своеобразно „връщане“ в Европа. Exe Solar продава продуктите си главно на Стария континент и Северна Африка.

Ръководството посочва, че производството ще бъде напълно екологично и няма замърсяване на околната среда. Производственият капацитет първоначално ще бъде 350 мегавата, а впоследствие ще бъде увеличен до 600 мегавата.

Италианският консорциум възнамерява да затвори производствения цикъл с изграждането и на фотоволтаичен парк. За целта е заявила и инвестиционно намерение за закупуване на 600 дка общински терени.

Справка на Economic.bg в Търговския регистър показва, че компанията има дружество в страната още от есента на 2019 г. За намеренията си да инвестира в Ямбол пък се говори от повече от година, сочат материалите в уебсайта на областната администрация на Ямбол.

Иновативният „зелен“ проект ще превърне Ямбол в един от пионерите на зелена енергия в България.",https://www.economic.bg/bg/a/view/exe-solar-izgrajda-zavod-za-13-mln-lv-v-jambol
