The factory is expected to have an initial capacity of 300 MW and reach 3 GW by 2026, producing solar panels using an unspecified heterojunction cell technology with an efficiency of up to 26.5%. MCPV also plans to produce tandem perovskite-silicon solar modules at the facility in the future, with cell efficiencies reaching over 30%.",https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/07/17/mcpv-to-build-3-gw-solar-cell-module-factory-in-netherlands/
MCPV receives public funding approval for its 3GW silicon Heterojunction solar cell manufacturing plant in The Netherlands – MCPV,2023-07-17,"Marc Rechter, CEO of MCPV: “With this important public support of the MCPV project, we have the opportunity to build an emerging European clean tech champion in the global PV market. Europe has the brains, technology, capital, and resources to build its own independent, competitive clean energy system, and the MCPV team is super proud to contribute towards this goal. We look forward to work with the broader Dutch and European value chain to create a resilient and profitable European PV industry, maximise ESG impact and create exciting opportunities for those that want to accelerate positive change.”",https://mcpv.eu/2023/07/17/dutch-government-allocates-e412-million-to-support-circular-pv-panel-manufacturing/
News – MCPV,,MCPV is happy to have contributed to the Made in Europe Photovoltaics documentary. It is more important than ever that the relevance of a robust European PV supply chain is communicated and how we can get there. Now its time to implement!,https://mcpv.eu/news/
Dutch solar manufacturing programme gets EUR 412m govt support,,"The SolarNL initiative designed to bring back solar manufacturing to the Netherlands and Europe has been awarded a subsidy by the Dutch government’s National Growth Fund.

The project will receive EUR 312 million (USD 340m) from the government, of which EUR 135 million awarded immediately and EUR 177 million conditionally, as well as a EUR-100-million loan.

The SolarNL programme groups nine Dutch solar technology companies -- Solarge, MCPV, HyET Solar, Compoform, Exasun, Energyra, Lightyear Layer, IM Efficiency and Taylor -- and research organisations, targetting the development and large-scale production of circular integrated solar cells and panels in the Netherlands. It will seek to develop and industrialise three innovative photovoltaic (PV) technologies: high-efficiency silicon heterojunction cells (HJT), flexible perovskite films, and PV products for integration into buildings and automotive applications.

MCPV said on Linkedin that the support includes its first GW-scale HJT cell manufacturing facility in Europe.

The overall budget of the programme is EUR 898 million, of which EUR 586 million is private financing.

The National Growth Fund represents a EUR-20-billion growth investment for the period 2021-2025. The SolarNL award came under its latest round.
