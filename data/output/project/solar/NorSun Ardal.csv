"NorSun Raises $8.6MM, Targets 5GW Solar Production Facility in USA",,"The new capital will be used to finalize plans for a five gigawatt production facility in the United States.

Norway’s privately held NorSun AS, which manufactures and markets mono-crystalline silicon ingots and wafers for the global solar energy industry, has raised $8.6 million (NOK 90 million) in new equity to finance the development of growth projects in the U.S. and Europe.

The new capital will be used to finalize plans for a five gigawatt (GW) production facility in the United States. NorSun will also assess plans to further expand in the Ardal in Vestland, Norway, targeting growth projects in the country as well as the rest of Europe, NorSun said in a news release.

Statkraft Ventures and Ardal Energi will come in as new shareholders of NorSun, investing $3.8 million (NOK 40 million) and $0.95 million (NOK 10 million), respectively. The remaining capital is subscribed for by three of the current main shareholders, Nysno Klimainvesteringer, Scatec Innovation, and ABN AMRO Sustainable Impact Fund, as well as the management of the company and some smaller shareholders, Norsun said.

“Through this transaction, existing shareholders, new investors and the company's creditors have made it possible for NorSun to utilize its position as the leading western wafer producer for further development and expansion, both in the USA and Europe”, Norsun Chairman John Andersen, Jr. said.

“We are very pleased to become the new partner in the journey of establishing a leading western wafer manufacturer”, Statkraft Venture Managing Director Anders Prietz said. “We believe NorSun as the only European wafer producer today is well positioned to succeed in building a new 5 GW production facility in the U.S."".

“NorSun's position as the leading Western producer of wafers for the solar cell industry has contributed to significant interest in our growth plans from customers and other business partners”, NorSun CEO Erik Lokke-Owre said. “Together with existing and new shareholders, the management will implement an ambitious growth plan. In the first phase, we will secure binding sales contracts and financing as the foundation for an investment decision for the US plant, which is expected at year-end"".

In July, ‍NorSun was awarded $59 million (EUR 54 million) in a grant from the European Union (EU) Innovation Fund for a 3-GW expansion of the company’s current ingot and wafer capacity in Årdal, according to an earlier news release.

The terms of the award will be negotiated during the second half of 2023, while customer negotiations and the implementation of a detailed technical preparation of an investment taking place in the same period, NorSun said in the release, adding that a decision is expected in the first quarter of 2024.

""We are very pleased to receive this award. It sends a strong signal to NorSun and the Norwegian authorities that the EU is serious when they urge Norway to take an active part in the solar value chain reconstruction”, Lokke-Owre said. “Norway can become the EU's strategic upstream partner for the solar sector based on the significant process industry expertise in high-purity silicon, silicon ingots and wafers that we have in Norway”.

“Now, the challenge is to clarify the Norwegian support conditions for an expansion so that NorSun can accept this award and not only develop Årdal, but continue growth also in other parts of the Norway"", Lokke-Owre added.

According to the company website, NorSun’s manufacturing facility in Ardal has a production capacity of one GW, with all of its production completely based on hydroelectric power, resulting in low carbon dioxide emissions.

"NorSun developing 5 GW U.S. solar wafer facility, Meyer Burger in the wings",2023-08-17,"The Norwegian ingot and wafer manufacturer NorSun has announced plans to expand into the United States with a 5 GW solar wafer factory. To kickstart this ambitious project, the company has secured $8.53 million (NOK 90 million). These funds will also potentially bolster operations at their home facility in Ardal, Norway.

Over half the funds were sourced from two new investors: Statkraft Ventures, which contributed $3.79 million, and Årdal Energi, which chipped in $0.95 million. Additionally, continued financial backing came from longstanding shareholders Nysnø Klimainvesteringer, Scatec Innovation, and ABN AMRO Sustainable Impact Fund. Both the company’s management and several smaller shareholders also made contributions.

Erik Løkke-Øwre, NorSun’s CEO, mentioned that the company is currently navigating the early stages of its expansion strategy. The goals include securing sales contracts with wafer purchasers, and subsequently gaining financing for the proposed facility. NorSun is optimistic about finalizing these plans by the close of the year.

The company did not announce who those sales contracts might be finalized with though.

However, pv magazine USA has closely followed Meyer Burger’s move into the U.S.. We reached out to Dr. Gunter Erfurt, CEO of Meyer Burger, to determine how close the NorSun announcement was being followed due to the two companies’ existing relationship (NorSun and Meyer Burger sign wafer deal in Europe).

pv magazine USA: Is Meyer Burger in talks with NorSun to purchase these wafers?

Dr. Erfurt: We have a strong relationship with NorSun and purchase wafers already for our manufacturing in Germany. Expanding this business is in the interest of both companies. And worth mentioning: NorSun produces best in class n-type wafers which meet our technological requirements potentially better than the products of their competitors.

pv magazine USA: Was the existing Meyer Burger/NorSun relationship part of the motivating action to deploy this factory?

Dr. Erfurt: NorSun is aware of MB‘s growth plans and we are aligning these as [well] as possible.

pv magazine USA: Does Meyer Burger see a path to expand the U.S. solar cell/module assembly capacity to 5 GW/year?

Dr. Erfurt: Yes.

pv magazine USA: Does Meyer Burger have imminent plans to announce the expansion to 5 GW if it is possible?

Dr. Erfurt: Yes, as soon as we have firm projects to be communicated. We informed in today’s H1 2023 call that we expect further offtake agreements potentially within this year.

Meyer Burger recently already announced two gigawatts of solar cell manufacturing and a similar amount of module manufacturing capacity. Both the solar cell and solar module facilities have additional space to carry deploy additional manufacturing lines.

Recently, NorSun received a grant of EU53.6 million ($58.4 million) from the EU Innovation Fund. This grant aims to expand their current facilities’ ingot and wafer manufacturing capacity from 1 GW to 3 GW. The estimated cost of this expansion stands at $300 million. Construction will begin in the first quarter of 2024, and upon completion, the facility is expected to employ 300 people.",https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/08/17/norsun-developing-5-gw-u-s-solar-wafer-facility-meyer-burger-in-the-wings/
Silfab Solar signs deal with NorSun for US-made wafers,2023-09-12,"From pv magazine USA

Silfab Solar and Norwegian ingot and wafer supplier NorSun have signed a deal for NorSun’s planned 5 GW ingot and wafer production facility in the United States.

In March Silfab Solar announced plans to invest $125 million investment to expand its facilities and launch a third cell and module fabrication facility in the United States. The company is planning 1 GW of cell production and 1.2 GW if module production, with operations to start in 2024.

NorSun recently raised $8.5 million in new equity to further develop clean energy manufacturing projects in the United States, including a 5 GW ingot and wafer production facility.

The companies will benefit from the support of the US Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which is stimulating a manufacturing renaissance. However, while much module manufacturing is expected in the United States, ingot wafer and cell production do not align.

According to the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), the current domestic solar module capacity is 8 GW. However, more than 155 GW of solar supply chain capacity expansions have been announced since the passing of the IRA. This has resulted in an estimated $20 billion investment across domestic communities, leading to various production additions, including:

85 GW of solar module capacity

43 GW of solar cells

20 GW of silicon ingots and wafers

7 GW of inverter capacity

Paolo Maccario, the CEO of Silfab Solar, said that the agreement with NorSun “adds strategic value to Silfab’s unwavering commitment to supply North America with domestically produced, high-performing solar panels.”

Meanwhile, Norsun has temporarily suspended wafer production in Norway, as module oversupply in Europe is affecting pricing across the solar value chain, resulting in employee layoffs through the end of this year. The company reports that it will continue to concentrate on its short-term and long-term expansion plans, including plans to upgrade its production line in Årdal, Norway.",https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/09/12/silfab-solar-signs-deal-with-norsun-for-us-made-wafers/
Solar wafer maker NorSun bags funds for 5-GW solar factory in US,,"Norwegian solar wafer maker NorSun has secured NOK 90 million (USD 8.7m/EUR 7.9m) in equity financing to back its capacity expansion ambitions in Europe and overseas, including a plan to build a 5-GW production facility in the US.

The funds were secured in a round led by Statkraft Ventures. The venture capital arm of state-owned utility Statkraft AS announced its NOK-40-million investment last week, along with a NOK-10-million commitment by Ardal Energi. NorSun has received additional financing from existing investors Nysno Klimainvesteringer, Scatec Innovation and Abn Amro Sustainable Impact Fund, as well as from the management of the company and some smaller shareholders.

Oslo-based NorSun will allocate the fresh funds to advance its plans for a manufacturing base in the US, which offers favourable framework conditions for the initiative. The company will also assess plans to further expand in the Ardal region of Norway’s Vestland county, and will target other growth projects in its home country and across Europe.

“Together with existing and new shareholders, the management will implement an ambitious growth plan. In the first phase, we will secure binding sales contracts and financing as the foundation for an investment decision for the US plant which is expected at year end,"" said CEO Lokke-Owre.

At present, NorSun runs a factory in Ardal, which kicked off wafer production in August 2009. Its capacity was doubled to 1 GW a decade after that, with the site now having 210 employees. In June, the company was awarded a EUR-53.6-million grant from the EU Innovation Fund to further expand the factory to 3 GW.
