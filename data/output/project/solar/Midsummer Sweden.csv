Midsummer secures funding for 200 MW Swedish solar factory,2023-12-06 00:00:00,"The European Commission announced in July that Midsummer’s project DAWN – a 200 MW-per annum plant producing lightweight and flexible CIGS, thin-film solar cells and panels – was selected among 41 projects for the European Union Innovation Fund.

Midsummer announced on Monday the company successfully signed a grant funding deal with the European Commission for €32.3 million ($34.8 million) to pay for a third of the yet-to-be-constructed “megafactory” costs.

Midsummer said in a press release it would secure the remainder of the funding through capital, loans and other unspecified public financing. The factory is tipped to produce thin cells suitable for European roofs in the first quarter of 2026.

Midsummer said its long-term goal is to expand the factory’s production to over 1 GW by 2030.

Midsummer and the EU sign agreement on EU grant for new Swedish solar cell factory,,"Negotiations on the conditions for the grant from the EU towards the construction of a new megafactory for the production of thin film solar cells in Sweden by Swedish solar energy company Midsummer have now been finalized and both parties have signed the agreement.

In July the EU Innovation Fund announced that it had selected the Swedish manufacturer of solar cells Midsummer for funding of EUR 32.3 million for a new solar cell factory in Sweden with the capacity to produce 200 MW solar cells annually.

After negotiations on the conditions for the grant, Midsummer and the EU Innovation Fund have now signed the grant agreement which, among other things, regulates the timetable for the construction, dates for payments of the grant, counter-financing, etc.

The objective of the project is to build a factory in Sweden for the production of 200 MW of thin film solar cells annually, which together with the factory that Midsummer is completing in Italy would give the group an annual production capacity of 250 MW of solar cells. (Completion and start of production of the Italian factory is completely independent of the support from the EU Innovation Fund.)

Start of production for the new Swedish factory is planned for the first quarter of 2026. Before that, during 2025, installation of equipment, test production for functionality tests, certification of the factory and training of personnel will take place. The factory which would provide around 250 jobs.

The project follows the timeline and scope as previously communicated. Before the first grant payment can take place, the project as a whole must have its financing secured. The grant from the EU Innovation Fund corresponds to approximately 50 percent of the counter-financing that is required for the grant to be awarded. Midsummer is now looking at options for the counter-financing which may include a combination of capital, loans and other public financing. Midsummer's long-term goal is to expand its total production to over 1 GW by 2030.

The EU innovation fund is one of the world's largest financing programs for innovative technology that contributes to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The grant is provided specifically for the construction of a factory in Sweden for the manufacture of Midsummer's proprietary CIGS thin film solar cells which are thin, light, flexible and with an ultra-low climate footprint. They are particularly suitable for installation on the many roofs around Europe that cannot withstand the weight of traditional silicon solar panels, as well as for the increasing number of organizations that strive for climate neutrality in their operations.

Midsummer successfully applies for 32 million euros in funding from the EU Innovation Fund for a new solar cell manufacturing megafactory in Sweden,,"Swedish solar energy company Midsummer has been selected by the EU to receive a grant of just over 32 million euros, approximately SEK 375 million, for a new 200 MW megafactory in Sweden for the production of CIGS thin film solar cells.

It is the EU innovation fund, one of the world's largest financing programs for innovative technology that contributes to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, that has selected Swedish Midsummer for funding of just over EUR 32 million for a new solar cell factory in Sweden.

The grant is specifically awarded for the construction of a factory in Sweden for the production of thin film solar cells of the CIGS type that are thin, light, flexible and with an ultra-low climate footprint. They are particularly suitable for installation on the many roofs around Europe that cannot support the weight of traditional silicon solar panels.

“It is of course very gratifying to be selected for this support for our new mega factory in Sweden,” said Sven Lindström, CEO, Midsummer. “Our ambition is to become Europe's largest manufacturer of thin film solar cells with several factories across Europe, and this support will naturally facilitate the establishment of our second European megafactory after the 50 MW factory in Italy that will soon open.”

In this round, the EU has allocated a total of 3.6 billion euros to 41 large-scale European projects for the launch of innovative clean technologies. The goal is to contribute to a European and global green transition with financial support for innovative technologies, processes or products, which are sufficiently mature and which have significant potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

“This is of course a stamp of approval for our technology, our future plans and for us as a company,” said Mr. Lindström. “The evaluation by the EU's experts is a needle's eye to pass through. We are one of a few scalable platforms in Europe and the most environmentally friendly. These are important factors for the EU, which wants to quickly reduce greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and above all to do so with domestic (European) manufacturers, value chains and products.”

The EU Innovation Fund received 239 applications in all categories, of which 41 were eventually selected for support after four months of evaluation. Midsummer is one of only three European solar companies selected for support. Of the total of 41 large-scale projects in all categories selected by the EU for financial support, three are Swedish; Midsummer, H2 Green Steel (green steel) and Biorefinery Östrand (green aviation fuel).

In the evaluation of Midsummer’s application, the EU gave the project top scores especially for scalability and the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions: ”the proposal offers good potential to create new value chains in Europe in the field of thin film PV manufacturing industry, which will have a positive impact on European competitiveness”.
