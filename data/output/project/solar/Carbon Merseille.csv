Why did CARBON choose Fos-sur-Mer and the Grand Port Maritime de Marseille for its first gigafactory?,2023-04-20 14:28:47+00:00,"Why did CARBON choose Fos-sur-Mer and the Grand Port Maritime de Marseille for its first gigafactory?

CARBON has announced on March 3, 2023 the location of its first gigafactory for photovoltaic products. This gigafactory will integrate the entire value chain to produce silicon wafers, cells and photovoltaic panels. The aim is to relocate the photovoltaic industry in France and Europe to supply a market currently largely dominated by China.

The facility will be located in Fos-sur-Mer, in the Grand Port Maritime de Marseille, in the Southern Region. Over ten sites were considered before this choice was made.

The Grand Port Maritime de Marseille, the Aix-Marseille Provence metropolitan area, the city of Fos-sur-Mer and the Southern Region joined forces to identify a 60-hectare site suited to CARBON’s needs. The support of the French government was also decisive!

Renaud Muselier, President of the Southern Region (Provence Alpes Côte d’Azur) and Deputy President of Régions de France, said: “I would like to thank the Prefect of the Region, the President of the Supervisory Board of the Port of Marseille-Fos, the President of the Aix-Marseille Provence Metropolis, and all the partners for their decisive support in this matter.”

A site focused on energetic and ecological transition

This policy alignment can be partially explained by the territory’s desire to become the first pilot region for ecological planning in France.

Renaud Muselier explains: “In this case, our success is the result of a very determined attractiveness strategy, which we have undertaken as the pilot region for ecological planning in France. Planning for solutions, and planning for jobs in the Southern Region, for a positive ecology, loaded with common sense!”

Today, the industrial port area of Fos-sur-Mer (ZIP) represents 20% of national industrial emissions. The goal, supported by the State and the Southern Region, is to halve the zone’s emissions by 2032. Furthermore, the Grand Port Maritime de Marseille wishes to encourage the establishment of ecological transition industries. Solar, hydrogen, batteries, wind power… The Port of Marseille Fos now aims to consolidate the industrial fabric with the implementation of new spaces.

“Environmental performance is a differentiating factor in the competition between major ports. The Port of Marseille Fos has made it a priority for a long time, and it is the thread that runs through its actions in order to safeguard and develop its business,” explains Christophe Castaner, Chairman of the Supervisory Board of the Grand Port Maritime de Marseille.

The Grand Port Maritime de Marseille, a strategic location for CARBON’s gigafactory logistics

The Fos-sur-Mer gigafactory in Marseille’s Grand Port-Maritime will have a production capacity of 5 GW of photovoltaic cells and 3.5 GW of modules. As a logistical result, CARBON’s future gigafactory will generate a flow of about 20,000 containers a year.

CARBON was therefore looking for a site capable of handling these flows. The Grand Port Maritime, with its direct road, rail, river and sea connections, offered a highly suitable configuration.

An attractive employment area for CARBON’s first photovoltaic gigafactory

The CARBON gigafactory will create over 3,000 direct jobs beyond the construction phase. The Fos-sur-Mer gigafactory will host a variety of job profiles: operators, technicians, supervisors, engineers, managers, sales and administrative positions…

CARBON is committed to training and facilitating employment opportunities for the local population. Finding an attractive employment area was crucial. Here, the industrial company will be able to draw on the region’s already existing employment and training resources.

“In addition to the 3,000 direct jobs and the investments announced, a whole industry will emerge in the region, boosting the already existing business network.” Martine Vassal – President of the Aix-Marseille-Provence Metropolis and the Bouches-du-Rhône Department.

What is the timeline for the CARBON gigafactory?

Announcing the site of the gigafactory is a first step for the CARBON project. The plant will be operational by the end of 2025, with an industrial ramp-up in 2026.

arpa-e.energy.gov,,"WASHINGTON, D.C. — The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) today announced up to $38 million in funding to develop sustainable carbon-containing liquids from renewable energy through the Grid-free Renewable Energy Enabling New Ways to Economical Liquids and Long‑term Storage (GREENWELLS) program. Managed by the DOE Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E), the new program seeks to develop chemical reactor systems that can store energy from sustainable, intermittent sources as low-carbon fuels or chemicals through an approach called renewables-to-liquids (RtL). By enabling the transportation and storage of renewable energy independent of the grid to maximize the benefits of distributed energy resources, GREENWELLS supports President Biden’s continued efforts to achieve a net‑zero economy by 2050 and reinforces America’s global competitiveness in the clean energy technologies of the future.



“At ARPA-E, we support transformational, impactful energy projects in order to fill the gaps and overcome the limits that must be addressed to meet our nation’s energy targets,” said ARPA-E Director Evelyn N. Wang. “I look forward to seeing these teams that will work to store and transport renewable energy as a liquid through our new GREENWELLS program.”

GREENWELLS will support projects that focus on the development of RtL reactor systems that can efficiently convert carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) and an intermittent feedstock of electricity or hydrogen (H 2 ) to carbon-containing liquids. Their work will include developing the necessary catalysts, manufacturing methods, and balance of plant.



Sustainable energy resources like wind and solar are most effective in areas typically not convenient for grid connection. GREENWELLS seeks to develop chemical reactors and supporting units with at least 50 percent electricity-to-liquid efficiency to store incoming intermittent electrical energy in liquid form.

GREENWELLS fuels could provide cost-effective energy carriers for long- and medium-term energy storage and potentially moderate supply and demand imbalances. They could also help decarbonize the aviation, marine, and heavy-duty transportation sectors. Low-carbon fuels and chemicals are currently expensive to produce, and less expensive electricity sources like remote wind and solar power could help drive down costs.

Visit the ARPA-E eXCHANGE website for more information about GREENWELLS, including key guidelines and dates for applicants.

ARPA-E advances high-potential, high-impact energy technologies across a wide range of technical areas that are too early for private-sector investment. Learn more about these efforts and ARPA-E's commitment to ensuring the United States continues to lead the world in developing and deploying advanced energy technologies.

Heliostat Consortium Roadmap and Request for Information

To further advance CSP technologies, DOE today also released a roadmap, developed by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), to guide research and deployment of heliostats, which are mirrors that follow the sun and concentrate sunlight in CSP plants. These components represent 30-40% of the cost of a CSP system, so reducing the cost of heliostats can make a significant impact on DOE’s goal of $0.05/kwh for CSP plants by 2030. Key areas the roadmap identifies as ripe for innovation include automated operation and machine learning, metrology, automated manufacturing and installation, as well as secure wireless controls. DOE’s Heliostat Consortium (HelioCon), a $25 million, 5-year research effort led by NREL and Sandia National Laboratories, in collaboration with the Australian Solar Thermal Research Institute, will work to implement the roadmap.

As the central hub for heliostat technology development in the United States, HelioCon seeks to significantly expand U.S. expertise in heliostats and increase the number researchers in the field. To achieve that goal, NREL today released a $3 million request for proposals (RFP) for research projects to work with them on these challenges. In addition to engaging external researchers, the RFP will seek to leverage unique expertise and test capabilities at the National Laboratories to advance the projects proposed by academic and industry partners. Responses are due by Nov. 8, 2022.
