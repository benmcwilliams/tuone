GM and Samsung partner to build a new $3 billion battery cell factory in the US,2023-04-25,"GM and Samsung SDI have announced that they are partnering to build a new $3 billion battery cell factory in the US to power GM’s electric vehicles.

It’s a change for GM, which has so far been mostly partnered with LG Energy for its battery cell supply.

For the last few years, GM has been heavily investing in battery manufacturing in the US in order to support its transition to electric vehicles.

It partnered with Korea’s LG to create Ultium Cells, a new joint venture to build battery cells in the US.

The partnership has already resulted in three battery factories in the US that are now in production or construction phases. There’s one in Ohio, one in Tennessee, and one in Michigan.

GM and LG have been working on a fourth US battery factory, but it was reported in January that the plan for a new battery plant in the US is on hold “indefinitely” after talks between GM and LG failed to move forward.

GM now partners with Samsung SDI

Now GM is announcing a partnership with Samsung SDI to build a new battery cell factory in the US:

General Motors Co. and Samsung SDI announced today they plan to invest more than $3 billion to build a new battery cell manufacturing plant in the United States that is targeted to begin operations in 2026.

In a press release, GM announced that the new factory will have a capacity of “more than 30 GWh” and it will bring GM’s total capacity in the US to about 160 GWh.

Interestingly, GM and Samsung are talking about building production lines to build both “nickel-rich prismatic and cylindrical cells.”

Doug Parks, GM executive vice president, Global Product Development, Purchasing and Supply Chain, commented:

We will continue to scale production and optimize the chemistry of our pouch cells for performance, range and cost using new approaches pioneered at GM’s Wallace Battery Center and by our technology partners. The introduction of new cell form factors will allow us to expand into even more segments more quickly and integrate cells directly into battery packs to reduce weight, complexity and costs. With multiple strong cell partners, we can scale our EV business faster than we could going it alone.

GM and Samsung SDI are not ready to disclose where in the US the new factory will be located.

Electrek’s Take

It’s an interesting development. GM seemed to have one of the strongest battery cell partnerships in the US with LG Energy through its Ultium Cells joint venture.

That partnership was certainly shaken by the Bolt EV battery recall, but it seemed to still be going strong. And it might still be going strong.

This might be just a smart move from GM to diversify its battery cell supply chain.",https://electrek.co/2023/04/25/gm-samsung-sdi-build-battery-cell-factory-us/
Samsung SDI expands battery production in Hungary,2021-02-24,"The Korean battery cell manufacturer Samsung SDI has announced that it will invest the equivalent of around 740 million euros in the expansion of its battery factory in Göd, Hungary, near Budapest.

The factory, from which Samsung SDI supplies cells for BMW and Volkswagen, among others, currently has an annual capacity of 30 GWh and is expected to be able to produce over 40 GWh in the future. Samsung SDI had completed the construction of the factory in 2017. It is not clear from the South Korean media reports when the expansion is to be completed.

With the investment of around one trillion won, which is equivalent to a little more than 900 million US dollars or the aforementioned 740 million euros, the Korean company apparently hopes to expand its position in the electric car market in Europe. The investment is to be partly financed by a capital increase of the Hungarian subsidiary Samsung SDI Hungary Zrt, but also by loans.

In South Korea, an unnamed representative of Samsung SDI told the Reuters news agency that the manufacturer was also considering building a second plant in Hungary. However, a decision or even a timetable for the construction of such a factory had not yet been made. In addition to Hungary, Samsung SDI has plants in South Korea and China. Worldwide, Samsung SDI ranks fifth among battery cell manufacturers.

Summary

Companies GM, Samsung SDI to invest over $3 bln to build joint EV battery plant in US

JV plant to start production in 2026, aims to have annual production capacity of 30 GWh

Location of plant not announced

News comes as South Korean President visits Washington

WASHINGTON, April 24 (Reuters) - General Motors Co (GM.N) and Samsung SDI (006400.KS) said on Tuesday they will invest over $3 billion to build a joint venture electric vehicle battery manufacturing plant in the U.S., as the automaker diversifies its component suppliers.

The news comes as South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol is in Washington to meet President Joe Biden on what is the first state visit to the U.S. by a South Korean leader in 12 years.

Yoon, who has made business opportunities a cornerstone of his foreign policy visits, is accompanied on the U.S. visit by more than 100 executives from South Korea's biggest companies, including Samsung Electronics (005930.KS) Executive Chairman Jay Y. Lee and Hyundai Motor Group Executive Chair Euisun Chung.

Expected to start in 2026, the joint GM and Samsung SDI plant aims to have an annual production capacity of 30 gigawatt hours (GWh), the two companies said in a statement, adding that the location of the planned JV plant is not yet decided. The plant will produce high-nickle prismatic and cylindrical battery cells.

Reuters reported on Monday that they two companies were set to unveil their plans for joint EV battery plant in the United States as early as Tuesday.

Detroit-based GM, like other automakers, is looking to diversify its battery supply chain and secure capacity of components to support its electrification goals as it attempts to catch up with Tesla Inc (TSLA.O).

""With multiple strong cell partners, we can scale our EV business faster than we could going it alone,"" GM executive Doug Parks said.

GM already has a joint venture (JV) in the U.S. with LG Energy Solution (373220.KS), and has been investing to ramp up cell production with the South Korean battery maker to take advantage of subsidies under the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act that aims to boost domestic manufacturing.

The U.S. Energy Department finalised a $2.5 billion loan to the GM-LG Energy JV late last year. The companies are building a $2.6 billion plant in Michigan, set to open in 2024, one of three JV Ultium Cells LLC plants.

They dropped plans for a fourth plant in New Carlisle, Indiana but GM could still pick the site for a battery plant with another partner, Reuters reported in January.

GM said last year it expects to build 400,000 electric vehicles (EVs) in North America from 2022 through mid-2024 and increase capacity to 1 million units annually in North America in 2025. Sources say GM is considering if it will eventually need at least two additional EV plants to meet future EV demand.

Biden, during a visit to Samsung in South Korea last year, urged companies to ""enter into partnerships"" with ""American union members"", saying JVs ""that manufacture electric vehicle batteries would be made stronger by collective bargaining relationships"" with U.S. unions.

Hyundai Motor Group and SK On, a battery unit of SK Innovation Co Ltd (096770.KS), plan to set up a battery JV in the U.S. state of Georgia, in an investment worth a combined about $4.86 billion, the two companies said on Tuesday.

Last year, car maker Stellantis NV and Samsung SDI said they would invest more than $2.5 billion to build a new JV battery plant in Kokomo, Indiana.

Stellantis and LG Energy said in 2022 they would invest $4.1 billion for a JV battery plant in Canada.

Most South Korean battery-related shares were down on Tuesday, with Samsung SDI shedding 3% as of 0407 GMT, versus a 1.8% drop in the broader market (.KS11).

Samsung was picked as the partner for the fourth plant after some Chevrolet Bolt batteries made by LG caught fire, forcing GM to recall about 142,000 vehicles due to a battery manufacturing problem. The recall cost GM about $1.9 billion, and the automaker said it was reimbursed for the cost by LG.

“We will do our best to provide the products featuring the highest level of safety and quality produced with our unrivaled technologies to help GM strengthen its leadership in the EV market,” Samsung SDI President and CEO Yoon-ho Choi said in a statement.

The new factory will have more than 30 gigawatt hours of capacity and will increase GM’s total U.S. battery cell capacity to about 160 gigawatt hours when it is at full production, the companies said.

GM has pledged to sell only electric vehicles by 2035. It has said that because of its huge investment in battery plants and a North American EV supply chain, six of its current or upcoming electric vehicles are to be eligible for the full $7,500 U.S. federal EV tax credit. They are the Chevrolet Bolt and Bolt SUV, the Chevrolet Silverado electric pickup, the Cadillac Lyriq SUV and the upcoming Chevy Blazer and Equinox electric SUVs.

Under the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act, EVs must be assembled in North America, and a certain percentage of their battery parts and minerals have to come from North America or a U.S. free trade partner to qualify for the full tax credit.

Workers at the Ohio battery plant have voted to join the United Auto Workers union, which is pushing to organize the other factories and get top wages for the workers. Union officials have said they must organize the battery plants so that workers making engines and transmissions have a place to go when jobs making internal combustion vehicles are phased out.

Electric vehicles have 30 percent to 40 percent fewer moving parts and require about 30% fewer labor hours to build them.",https://www.mprnews.org/story/2023/04/25/gm-samsung-plan-new-ev-battery-cell-factory-in-us
