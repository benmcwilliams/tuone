Tesla reveals plan for Gigafactory Berlin expansion with battery production and more,2023-07-19 00:00:00,"Tesla has revealed its plan for Gigafactory Berlin expansion with battery production and more, as it seeks approval for the plan.

Gigafactory Berlin is Tesla‚Äôs first full-scale factory in Europe.

It is now producing over 5,000 Model Y vehicles per week, but the automaker always had much bigger plans for the factory.

Tesla is currently approved for the production of 500,000 cars per year at the plant.

Now the automaker has submitted plans for a significant expansion that would allow for the production of 1 million vehicles per year and 100 GWh of battery production.

Here are the new plans for Tesla Gigafactory Berlin:

The new plan also includes a water recycling facility, a new logistics area, more battery storage, solar roof, and something called ‚Äúsolar roof charging.‚Äù

The new expansion would happen in three stages with the first one being operational in the first half of 2024 if it is approved.

However, Tesla has had some delays in receiving approval the first time around and the same could happen again.",https://electrek.co/2023/07/19/tesla-reveals-plan-gigafactory-berlin-expansion-battery-production/
Tesla Gigafactory Berlin looks to start battery production in Q1 2023: report,2022-09-13 13:13:10+00:00,"By

Tesla Gigafactory Berlin is still in its early stages, but the Germany-based electric vehicle factory is aiming for some ambitious targets of its own. Among these is the facility‚Äôs battery production, which is reportedly expected to begin sometime in the first quarter of 2023.

Tesla‚Äôs next generation of vehicles is expected to be powered by the company‚Äôs next-generation 4680 cells. The company currently equips some Texas-made Model Y with 4680 batteries, but in the future, Tesla‚Äôs vehicle lineup is expected to adopt the new battery form factor. Gigafactory Berlin appears to be one site that is actively planning on equipping its vehicles with the new, larger batteries.

As noted in a B.Z. report, Tesla presented its 4680 battery technology in Grunheide this past Sunday. Tesla explained that instead of using thousands of small lithium-ion cells for its vehicles, the company intends to roll out cars that are equipped with significatly fewer but larger 4680 cells. The 4680 batteries are faster and cheaper to manufacture, and they are more environmentally friendly.

Tesla‚Äôs session appears to have attracted quite a lot of attention. On Sunday, about 1,000 visitors took the time to learn about the electric vehicle maker‚Äôs new battery technologies. Questions about training and jobs at Gigafactory Berlin were reportedly addressed as well.

Acc to B.Z. information, battery production is to start ""in the first quarter of 2023‚Äú



Further: Atm, the plant produces a good 1,500 a week



Motor production is to begin in Gr√ºnheide as early as this yearhttps://t.co/S09fgRJbYz pic.twitter.com/iv4aj78XFA ‚Äî Berlinergy (@Berlinergy) September 12, 2022

Citing information that it acquired, German news outlet B.Z. noted that the interior work for Gigafactory Berlin‚Äôs battery factory is already underway. Barring any unforeseen delays, 4680 battery production could begin ‚Äúin the first quarter of 2023.‚Äù The target is reportedly to produce enough batteries to support 500,000 Teslas per year, the estimated optimum output of Giga Berlin‚Äôs current state.

Gigafactory Berlin still has quite a long way to go before it is fully ramped. The facility is estimated to produce only about 1,500 Model Y per week for now, but eventually, this output is expected to increase to about 10,000 cars per week. Mastering the production of 4680 cells is an uphill journey as well, as the larger cells utilize a dry-coat electrode process, which is quite different from conventional battery-making techniques.

Tesla Gigafactory Berlin looks to start battery production in Q1 2023: report",https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-gigafactory-berlin-battery-production-q1-2023/
Tesla‚Äôs first full battery cell factory will produce up to 250 GWh ‚Äî roughly the current world capacity,2020-11-24 00:00:00,"Tesla‚Äôs first full-scale battery cell factory, which is located at Tesla Gigafactory Berlin, will produce up to 250 GWh, according to new comments from Elon Musk.

That‚Äôs roughly the current world battery cell production capacity.

At its ‚ÄúBattery Day‚Äù earlier this year, Tesla unveiled its own battery cell, the Tesla 4680, and explained its plan to produce its own battery cells for the first time.

Tesla is currently ramping up production at its pilot production line in Fremont.

As we previously reported, Tesla has designed the entire production system called Roadrunner in-house, and it is currently using the production line to improve on its machinery with the goal to deploy a full-scale factory using the production system.

Tesla is believed to be planning to deploy these full-scale battery cell factories at its current Gigafactory projects in Berlin, Texas, and China.

Based on how construction has been progressing, it looks like the battery factory in Berlin is going to be the first one ready.

Last week, we reported on how Tesla started hiring for its battery cell factory at Gigafactory Berlin.

Now Elon Musk commented on what kind of battery capacity Tesla plans to deploy at the site in a new battery conference in Europe:

The CEO said about the new battery factory:

I think it will possibly be the largest battery cell plant in the world. I think it will be the largest. It will be capable of over 100 GWh per year and possibly over time, it will be going over 200 to 250 GWh. I‚Äôm pretty confident that at that point, it will be the largest battery cell plant in the world.

Bloomberg estimates that 250 GWh is just under the current world production capacity for li-ion battery cells ‚Äî though that could more than double by the time Tesla reaches that kind of capacity at Gigafactory Berlin:

In order to achieve that kind of capacity, Musk said that Tesla still needs to improve its production processes at the pilot plant to achieve higher cycle time for the first full-scale factory in Berlin.

Tesla also needs to redesign some machinery for ‚Äúcontinuous flow operation.‚Äù

As Tesla explained on battery day, the production processes developed for the automaker‚Äôs new battery cell are supposed to be more capital and energy efficient and also have a smaller carbon footprint ‚Äî making the battery cells cleaner to produce.

Tesla hasn‚Äôt provided a clear timeline for the start of battery production at Gigafactory Berlin, but it is expected to start around the same time as vehicle production, which they officially aim to achieve in July 2021.

That‚Äôs because the automaker plans to use its new structural battery pack technology to produce the Model Y in Berlin and that requires the new 4680 battery cells.

However, Tesla said that it will support the production of the European Model Y with battery cell production at its pilot production facility.

Therefore, the timing for battery cell production at the new factory is not completely clear at this point.

Electrek‚Äôs Take

That‚Äôs a lot of battery cells.

100 GWh should be enough for the production of 1 million vehicles per year, which is expected to be the production capacity of Gigafactory Berlin by the time it reaches full capacity.

But Tesla could also produce electric semi trucks, which use more than 10 times the amount of batteries of an average electric car, and it could also produce battery cells for stationary storage applications like Powerwalls, Powerpacks, and Megapacks.

The battery factory could also supply other Tesla factories, but I think by the time Tesla can ramp up to over 100 GWh, it will also have battery cell production at other locations, which would make sense to lower logistical costs.
