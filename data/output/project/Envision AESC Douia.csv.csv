Envision AESC downgrades battery plans for Douai,2021-11-15,"The Envision AESC battery factory at Renault’s Douai site in northern France is to be smaller than originally announced. Instead of the capacity of 43 GWh by 2030, only 30 GWh or more are planned by 2029, according to an agency report. The background is apparently a change of location.

Bloomberg refers to an official document of the French authority CNDP, the Commission Nationale du Débat Public. There, the new planned production capacity of 30 GWh until 2029 is mentioned. When it was announced in June, production capacity was envisaged at 24 GWh by 2027 and 43 GWh by 2030.

The downsizing follows the decision to build the plant on a car park next to Renault’s Douai assembly plant instead of in a wooded area, according to project manager Ayumi Kurose. Because of wildlife living there, there would have been some hurdles in getting permission for species protection reasons. “It would have been complicated to build a battery factory in that zone,” Kurose said.

Instead of one large factory in the forest area, Envision AESC is now planning four smaller plants – three of which will come to about nine GWh, and one to 4.5 GWh. The Chinese company will initially invest around 800 million euros in Douai and employ up to 1,200 people, with construction to begin by the end of 2024. Of the production, nine GWh are reserved for Renault at the outset, according to current information – but the carmaker itself had already announced that it would need up to 24 GWh from Envision AESC by the end of the decade – that would be the majority of the currently planned plant.

According to Bloomberg, Envision AESC itself is in talks with “at least five other carmakers in Europe”. Without further expansion, however, only smaller delivery volumes would probably be possible here if Renault really wants to purchase 24 GWh. According to Envision project manager Kurose, output could still be increased with several smaller factories – but this is still being examined.

The battery factory in Douai is part of the eMobility industry cluster Renault ElectriCity, which was also announced in the summer. Under the new umbrella company, the electric car activities of the Renault plants in Douai, Maubeuge and Ruitz in northern France are to be bundled and 400,000 vehicles per year are to be built from 2025. From the Douai battery plant, Renault plans to source NMC cells with a more “affordable” cell chemistry for the volume vehicles. Performance cells will continue to be supplied by long-time battery partner LG Energy Solution. Renault has also entered into a partnership with the French start-up Verkor, from which the carmaker plans to source up to ten GWh of high-performance cells (probably mainly for the electric Alpine models).

US: Envision AESC Targets 70 GWh/Year Of Battery Manufacturing Capacity,,"Envision AESC confirmed a second large EV battery gigafactory project in the US this year, towards its target to increase annual manufacturing capacity to 70 GWh (and 300+ GWh globally).

The latest investment is a dedicated 30 GWh battery plant in South Carolina, which will produce cylindrical lithium-ion battery cells for the BMW Group's Plant Spartanburg. Those are BMW's sixth-generation battery cells with a standard diameter of 46 mm (similar to Tesla) - see more details here.

According to Envision AESC, the company is currently working to finalize a suitable site close to BMW Group’s vehicle production and battery assembly facilities.

We guess that once the company will secure a plot, we will get some more details.

Envision AESC (formerly AESC - Nissan and NEC's JV - acquired by the Envision Group in 2019, in which Nissan - as far as we know - still holds a 20% share) is a battery arm of global green tech company Envision Group.

The new battery gigafactory in South Carolina will come on top of the battery gigafactory in Bowling Green, Kentucky, which was announced in April 2022. The factory in Kentucky also will have an output of 30 GWh per year (although with an option for 40 GWh/year). The type of battery cells might be different, since the customers will be different.

Envision AESC also has a small facility at the Nissan manufacturing site in Smyrna, Tennessee, US (probably only 3.0 GWh per year, according to previous reports).

Global expansion

Envision AESC is quickly expanding its manufacturing capabilities with new plants in Japan (up to 18 GWh/year), UK (up to 38 GWh/year), France (30 GWh/year ""or more"" by 2029), Spain (up to 50 GWh/year) and in China (a few plants).

All those projects combined indicate that the former Nissan's joint venture AESC is going big under the Chinese Envision Group.

DOUAI EV BATTERY GIGAFACTORY,,"The project concerns the implementation in Europe of an advanced manufacturing technology for the production of advanced li-ion battery cells. The latter is considered a key enabler for the development of the European EV industry.





The company achieved an important milestone in the prototyping of the cells and now needs to follow suit with getting it in a stable serial production at acceptable scrap rate, the hardest part in this high-tech industry by some accounts.





The project could make a substantial contribution to the development of the EU-based battery industry. The knowledge spillovers in Europe are related to the cooperation with the French EPC constructor for the development and construction of the highly specialised building (clean room, utilities), and with regional technical schools for the up/re-skilling of the labour force.





The project caters for the transition in e-mobility by supplying the growing demand in Europe for EV Batteries with advanced battery cells. It therefore qualifies in full as Climate Action (mitigation).





The project is located in a cohesion region where it will create significant long-term skilled employment. It therefore qualifies in full under Cohesion.





The operation qualifies for InvestEU eligibility under the following main policy priority areas:

SIW:

1.1.6 Modernisation and decarbonisation of industry

(a) decarbonisation investments in industries, in particular transport, aiming at significant reduction or avoidance of GHG emissions; and

(c) investments in assets enabling the flow of low-carbon energy.





Europe must master the de-carbonisation of its transport sector. This passes through the transformation of its automotive industry from supplying vehicles running on carbon fuels to vehicles running on electricity. This in turn requires the build-up of an innovative European battery industry. Europe lags behind in the development and industrialisation of battery technologies and the related know-how.

The project addresses these failures.

The project:

(a) has the nature of a public good for which the operator or company cannot capture sufficient financial benefits (knowledge dissemination through technology transfer and education and skills of the local labour, and a lasting specialised infrastructure being made available at no or negligible cost, both in a Cohesion Region);

(b) generates externalities which the operator or company fails to internalise, such as climate mitigation.

The financing also addresses the market failure of insufficient investment in a transition region and thus supporting the strengthening of the EU's economic, social and territorial cohesion.





The Project's external benefits are potentially high as it contributes to the establishment of an industrial value chain in Europe of a competitive battery technology. The Project will lead to important knowledge transfer to Europe. It will deploy advanced manufacturing activities and related high skilled jobs in Europe. The Project will furthermore help creating the conditions for the deployment of e-mobility, and the development of a cleaner and more sustainable transport system In Europe and lead to lower emissions of pollutants (health benefits) and CO2 (climate benefits) on the roads.





The proposed non-recourse structure is innovative for this type of project, traditionally financed through corporate loans by commercial banks at sponsors' level. EIB's capability to appraise and structure the Project with unmatched terms and conditions on the commercial market would bring significant added value to the Promoter. EIB will not only close a large financing gap but also crowd in other financiers. The increased risk profile of the loans (loan tenor potentially going beyond the Renault offtake contract and being exposed to a mix of substantial market / technology / offtaker creditworthiness risks, subject to acceptability being confirmed during appraisal) beyond what the Bank traditionally regards as acceptable, can be considered thanks to Invest EU protection.





Considering the above, the project will generate economic benefits that are greater than those captured by the investor's financial returns.





The operation would not be carried out to the same extent by the EIB without the InvestEU support.",https://www.eib.org/en/projects/all/20220168

"The French President, Emmanuel Macron, visited the factory in Douai",,"June 28th, 2021, Renault Group announced its strategy to produce EV batteries in France. For the event, Jean-Dominique Senard and Luca de Meo, Chairman of the Board of Directors and CEO of Renault Group, welcomed the French President, Emmanuel Macron, to factory in Douai. The president met factory employees and welcomed the investments that will ultimately create 4,500 direct jobs.

With the planned construction of an EV battery Gigafactory in Douai as part of the new ElectriCity industrial hub, Renault Group endeavours to create first EV ecosystem in Europe. Thanks to an investment of more than €3 billion, some 4,500 direct jobs will be created in France by 2030. French President, Emmanuel Macron, was joined by various ministers and local MPs – including Regional President Xavier Bertrand – as they visited the Renault factory in Douai. The visit was of particular importance for those who work at the site, as it served to officially recognise their commitment and expertise.

“Today, we are tackling the challenges of tomorrow, specifically, that of impending climate change. Investing in the electric vehicles and batteries is the only way to tackle modern issues and prepare for the future, by creating further jobs here in the Hauts de France."" Emmanuel Macron, President of France



Two major partnerships behind the construction Europe's first EV ecosystem

Producing low carbon emitting batteries and working on closed-circuit recycling solutions of production by-products and end-of-life batteries are major assets for Renault Group in its efforts to become carbon neutral across Europe by 2040 and around the world by 2050. This is particularly so with electric vehicles making up 90% of all Renault sales by 2030. Last Monday, in an effort to move closer to reaching these targets, the Group announcing two partnerships for EV battery design and production:

A strategic partnership with Envision AESC – a global player in low-carbon batteries and long-term partner of Nissan – to set up a Gigafactory in Douai, as part of Renault ElectriCity, to produce last-generation, low-carbon, cost-competitive batteries. The Douai Gigafactory will reach a capacity of 9 GWh by 2024 and has a target of 24 GWh by 2030. It will be located near the Renault ElectriCity production sites at Douai, Maubeuge, and Ruitz.

A memorandum of understanding with French start-up Verkor to co-develop then manufacture high-performance batteries. The Grenoble-based start-up specializes in the development of battery cells. This partnership would initially involve funding R&D work at the Verkor Innovation Centre and work on a pilot project of French-based prototyping and production of battery cells and modules as early as 2022. Second, Verkor will roll out its plan to create the first Gigafactory of high-performance batteries in France, with an initial capacity of 10 GWh by 2026 – for Renault Group – and up to 20 GWh by 2030.

These two partnerships, along with work coming out of the Renault ElectriCity hub, will help with the creation of nearly 4,500 direct French jobs by 2030 and the development of EV battery manufacturing ecosystem right in the heart of Europe.

""The new partnerships with Envision AESC and Verkor will significantly strengthen our position to produce one million ‘made in Europe’ electric vehicles by 2030. This is the Group’s way of restating its willingness to produce popular, affordable, and cost-effective electric cars in France. "", said Luca de Meo, CEO of Renault Group.

Another milestone that goes hand in hand with other mechanisms already in place within Renault Group, such as the agreement with LG Chem which is currently a supplier for Renault’s EV range and will provide battery modules for the up-coming Megane E-TECH Electric.

""Producing large quantities of batteries will be crucial. Today, 85% of global battery production comes from Asia. Tomorrow, the Douai site will produce hundreds of thousands of batteries every year for French cars. These partnerships set Renault Group in the right direction and serve to further bolster the Alliance! “, said Jean-Dominique Senard, Chairman of the Board of Directors

A strategy that serves the environment and French jobs

""Today, we celebrate good news: that of attractiveness that has grown through the Envision investment; and that of employment. With the EV battery project developed in Douvrin, we see a true European valley for electric vehicles emerge."" Emmanuel Macron, President of France

The French President was shown the latest products that will drive the future of the three factories: All-New Kangoo for Maubeuge, All-New Megane E-TECH Electric for Douai, and a new battery tray for the Ruitz factory that also manufactures the E-TECH DB 35 gearbox.",https://www.renaultgroup.com/en/news-on-air/news/the-douai-factory-is-now-at-the-heart-of-the-groups-industrial-strategy-for-batteries/
Envision’s $810M Florence battery plant sets groundbreaking date,,"By Chris Day cday@postandcourier.com

FLORENCE — Envision AESC will break ground on its $810 million electric vehicle battery manufacturing plant June 7 in a deal that will support one of South Carolina’s biggest carmakers.

The 1.5 million-square-foot factory, which will be in Florence County’s 900-acre Technology and Commerce Park at Estate Road and Old Marion Highway, will create 1,170 jobs.

The facility will encompass 500 acres. It’s scheduled to start production in late 2025.

Japan-based Envision AESC, which was co-founded by Nissan, is partnering with BMW Manufacturing’s Upstate plant to develop lithium-ion battery cells to power future electric vehicles.

At its May 18 meeting, Florence County Council unanimously granted an easement to Duke Energy Progress to relocate an electricity distribution line along the western edge of Estate Road to bring more power to the Envision plant.

Duke Energy needs to upgrade the line, and it will pay for it, County Administrator Kevin Yokim said.

The S.C. Commerce Department’s Coordinating Council of Economic Development awarded a $135 million closing fund grant to the county to assist with project-related costs. It also awarded state tax credits that are tied to the number of jobs Envision creates, according to a statement.

South Carolina authorized issuing up to $70 million in state bonds for off-site infrastructure and a training center to support the project.

County Council and city of Florence also put together incentives packages, including an agreement that replaces Envision’s property taxes with a fee, and a land-acquisition deal and up to $20 million to provide streets, water and wastewater services to the plant site.

At its May 18 meeting, County Council also approved incentives for unidentified company known as “Project Mimosa” that is planning to invest $20 million and create 29 full-time jobs, Yokim said.",https://www.fcedp.com/news/envisions-810m-florence-battery-plant-sets-groundbreaking-date
Envision AESC to build battery factory in France,2021-06-25,"Chinese battery manufacturer Envision AESC is said to be aiming for a battery factory at Renault’s Douai site in northern France that will offer an annual production capacity of 24 GWh by 2027 and 43 GWh by 2030 in several expansion stages.

The news was broken via several media reports citing insider and a report by the French authority Commission nationale du débat public (CNDP). According to the report, of the total capacity of 43 GWh, a good half – 24 GWh – will be reserved for future Renault electric models such as the electric Renault 5. The investment volume is said to amount to around 2 billion euros. The plans will probably be officially announced in a few days at an event hosted by French President Emmanuel Macron.

Renault has also announced a digital event for coming Wednesday, which will focus on the manufacturer’s comprehensive focus on e-mobility. The Envision AESC battery factory in Douai is expected to complement the recently announced Renault ElectriCity mobility industry cluster. The new umbrella company will combine the electric car activities of the Douai, Maubeuge and Ruitz plants in northern France and build 400,000 vehicles per year from 2025.

Envision AESC is linked to Renault’s alliance partner Nissan. Nissan had sold its battery subsidiary AESC to Envision Group in 2018, but still holds a minority stake of 20 per cent. At the end of May, it was reported that Nissan plans to invest more than 200 billion yen (just under 1.5 billion euros) in battery factories for electric cars in the UK and Japan, together with Envision AESC.

Bloomberg reports that the partnership with Envision AESC is said to be part of a broader plan that could also see Renault take a stake in French battery start-up Verkor. Talks on a third battery deal are said to be underway with ACC; a subsidiary of Stellantis and Total. Representatives of all the companies mentioned declined to comment to the news agency. Currently, Renault buys its batteries from LG Energy Solution in Poland, among others.

According to the above-mentioned French authority CNDP, Douai is not yet fixed as the location for the battery factory. The coastal town of Dunkerque in northern France is also said to be in the running. The final choice will depend, among other things, on how quickly permits are granted and how the development prospects are assessed. Incidentally, all the sources mentioned only talk about the settlement of a “battery factory”. It therefore remains unclear whether it will be a plant for the production of battery cells or for the assembly of battery modules and systems. The former is to be assumed, since Envision AESC is known for the production of cells.

SC legislators sweeten the pot with $50M in added incentives for Florence EV battery plant,,"Commerce said the new investment will be on top of those totals, taking the project to $1.21 billion and 1,570 jobs. Details of that expansion will be released at a later date.

Neither Lightsey nor the committee — made up of legislators from the House and Senate — mentioned Envision AESC by name during Tuesday's meeting, but documents included in the committee's agenda package reference the previous debt deal that was linked to Project Samurai and later identified as the Florence plant.

The new incentives deal would give the company $30 million for site preparation work, which received no funding in the previous incentives agreement.

The new deal also gives the company millions more for a training facility, road improvements, water and sewer infrastructure and underground building support structures.

The bond proceeds would be spent over five years and repaid from general state revenues over 20 years.

Envision AESC also received a $135 million state grant to help pay for the Florence project.

The Pee Dee factory will make cylindrical cells for batteries used in electric vehicles. A single EV will have, on average, between 5,000 and 9,000 of the components to store and supply the power it needs to run.

The plant aims to supply BMW with battery cells for the EVs the German company plans to make at its Spartanburg County car-making operation.

Envision AESC is headquartered in Japan and was founded in 2007 as a joint venture between three Japanese companies, with Nissan as its largest shareholder. In 2018, China-based Envision acquired a majority stake in the business.

Federal guidelines issued last week would make EVs ineligible for tax credits if battery components are made by a company that's subject to the jurisdiction of China’s government or is at least 25 percent owned by a Chinese government authority.",https://www.postandcourier.com/business/south-carolina-legislators-incentives-envision-aesc-battery-plant-florence/article_a0c2135c-938b-11ee-9e94-6f951e816d00.html
