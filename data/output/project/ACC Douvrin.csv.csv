ACC to build next battery factory in Italy for Stellantis,2022-03-23,"Stellantis has officially confirmed plans to build a third Automotive Cells Company (ACC) battery factory in Termoli, Italy. For this purpose, Stellantis’ existing engine plant will be converted into a battery factory.

By 2030, the joint venture of Stellantis, Total and, since September 2021, Mercedes-Benz, aim for total battery cell capacities of at least 120 GWh. The Termoli plant will have a capacity of 40 GWh in this, while two other ACC plants in Douvrin (France) and Kaiserslautern (Germany) are planned to be upgraded from their initial 24 GWh each to 40 GWh each to complete the bill.

The move to turn the Termoli engine plant into a battery cell factory had been in the offing for a long time. At the “EV Day” last July, Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares confirmed that the group had concluded a corresponding agreement on the future of Termoli with the Italian government.

“We are grateful to everyone involved in this investment to secure the future of the great community in Termoli,” Tavares now says, according to the latest news release. “Transforming the existing plant to help support a more sustainable future positions ACC as the European leader in battery manufacturing and reaffirms, thanks to the collaboration with the Ministry of Economic Development, Italy’s role in supporting Stellantis’ transformation to a sustainable mobility tech company.”

It is unknown when Stellantis or ACC will comment on further plans for Termoli and the potential sites 4 and 5. So far, the finalisation of plans for Termoli is still “subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals”, Stellantis writes.

What is clear, however, is that the entry of Mercedes-Benz is now signed and sealed, and in this case, the regulatory approvals have been granted. The “agreement to include Mercedes-Benz as a new equal partner with TotalEnergies/Saft and Stellantis” has been concluded, according to the statement.

Update 29 June 2022

Details on the timetable for Automotive Cells Company’s (ACC) third battery factory in Termoli, Italy, have emerged following a union representative meeting with Stellantis. The conversion of Stellantis’ current engine plant in Termoli into a battery factory will begin in 2024, with production to start by 2026. ACC expects the battery factory to reach total capacity in 2030 with around 2,000 employees.

However, the schedule will also significantly impact employment at the site. Since Stellantis will phase out engine production in large parts in 2024, but battery production is not to start on a smaller scale until 2026, the union expects layoffs. According to Reuters, up to 1,000 employees will lose their job at the peak before 2,000 workers are expected to return to the plant in 2030. According to union sources, some “premium” internal combustion engines will still be built until 2026 – but with the start of battery production, that will also be the end of the line there, so that the areas can also be converted as a result.

Gianluca Ficco of UILM told Reuters that Stellantis had assured unions that all Termoli workers would be employed at the new Gigafactory. “This is good, but not enough, clearly we want a formal and binding commitment by ACC,” he said. “Then we’ll have to sort out how to manage temporary layoffs.” In addition to retraining, employees will be offered to work at the battery plant in Douvrin, France, for up to six months.

A Stellantis spokesman confirmed to the news agency that unions had been given an update on development plans for Termoli but did not comment on the detailed information.

TORONTO/PARIS, Aug 1 (Reuters) - French-based Automotive Cells Co (ACC) is in early talks with officials in Canada and the United States on setting up a battery manufacturing plant in North America, an ACC spokesperson told Reuters on Tuesday.

ACC is a joint venture between Stellantis (STLAM.MI), Total Energies (TTEF.PA) and Mercedes-Benz Group (MBGn.DE).

Its representatives met with officials from the Quebec government in Canada, from the mayor's office in the city of Mirabel in Quebec, and with representatives of the federal government in the province in May this year, according to the provincial and federal government lobby registry.

The lobbying efforts were to enquire about direct funding, incentives and grants related to site selection, development and construction of a new battery processing facility in the province of Quebec, according to public documents.

""ACC is conducting simple exploratory studies, without commitment. We are focused on executing our already very ambitious European industrial and technological roadmap,"" a company spokesperson told Reuters in a statement.

Canadian government officials were not available for an immediate comment. Officials from Invest Quebec declined to comment.

ACC said it was exploring plans in North America but gave no details on talks it has held in the United States.

The federal and provincial government lobby registry showed that the talks have terminated. According to a person familiar with ACC's thinking, the discussions are still under way, ""but they may be complicated in the light of what happened between Stellantis and LG and the Canadian government.""

The source was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and requested anonymity.

Last month , Stellantis resolved a dispute with the Canadian government over subsidies to build an EV plant with its South Korean LG Energy Solution , under which the project could receive incentives up to C$15 billion ($11 billion).

ACC, which was launched in 2020, has announced electric-vehicle battery plants in Germany, France and Italy with a 7 billion-euro ($7.7 billion) investment.

Global auto companies and EV battery makers have been eying the North American market to set up new manufacturing plants, as Canadian and the U.S. governments roll out incentives to manufacturers, in an effort to lower their reliance on China for critical minerals.

In Canada, the provincial government of Quebec is hoping that its proximity to the U.S. port cities will help it gather some investments in the EV battery space to its province. The government has been funding lithium explorers and battery manufacturers.

Automotive Cells Company opens Douvrin Battery Factory in France,,"Automotive Cells Company (ACC), a joint venture between Stellantis, Total, and Mercedes-Benz, held a grand opening for their Douvrin battery factory in France. Commercial production is expected to begin by the end of 2023.

Automotive Cells Company (ACC) opened its first battery gigafactory in France. The lithium-ion battery factory was constructed in the Billy-Berclau Douvrin in the Hauts-de-France region, spanning over 60,000 square metres of land. Commercial production at the factory is expected by the end of 2023 with an estimated 8GWhpy of capacity. ACC states that the factory will reach its expected initial 13GWhpy production capacity by the end of 2024.

Beyond 2024, two additional production lines will be constructed within the factory to reach the limit of 40GWhpy capacity by 2030. Alongside the construction in Douvrin, ACC is also constructing two additional battery factories in Europe, one in Italy, and one in Germany.

Of the 60,000 square metres of production space, one-third, or 20,000 square metres, is a designated dry room. Sixteen mixers, with a volume of 1,600 litres each, have been installed in the hall to mix the active materials and auxiliary substances. Overall, capacity is expected to reach 56,000 cells per day, enough for 2.4 million battery modules, or between 200,000 and 300,000 Electric Vehicles (EV) per year, from the announced 13GWhpy capacity.

Project Blue’s battery demand outlook forecasts that EU battery demand will surpass 1 terawatt-hour per year by 2033. In response to this growing demand, ACC and others will need to significantly accelerate and grow the number of gigafactory projects in Europe in order for that demand to be met through domestic production within the region.",https://projectblue.com/blue/news-analysis/473/automotive-cells-company-opens-douvrin-battery-factory-in-france
ACC granted funding to make batteries in Germany,2021-09-02,"ACC, the Franco-German initiative comprising PSA, Opel and Saft, has received funding notifications from the Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology (BMVi) and the state of Rhineland-Palatinate to start constructing a battery cell factory in Germany as part of the EU’s Battery IPCEI.

The federal and state governments are funding the project with a total of 436.8 million euros. They expect to see the joint venture Automotive Cell Company (ACC) start making batteries at the Opel plant in Kaiserslautern in two years.

Many steps have preceded the handover of the funding notification. ACC was founded at the end of 2018 in expectation of the European call for battery manufacturing, then still running under the catchphrase “Battery Airbus”. In December 2019, the EU Commission approved the first round of the official ‘Battery IPCEI’ as an “important project of common European interest.” At that time, a total of €3.2 billion in funding was earmarked for pan-European research and innovation projects from seven member states on all segments of the battery value chain.

In the case of ACC, the Franco-German consortium fired the starting gun to kick-off pilot production in January 2020 at a Saft facility in France. The partners will develop cell technology there before beginning production at scale at the actual battery plants in Douvrin and Kaiserslautern, each with a volume of 24 GWh per year.

The funding decision for 436.8 million has now been handed over to ACC, which PSA, its subsidiary Opel and TotalEnergies subsidiary Saft officially established in September 2020 for battery cell production. The sum already includes 51 million euros from the state of Rhineland-Palatinate, so the BMWi is taking over around 386 million euros. The companies involved in the joint venture are investing over two billion euros for this purpose.

At the handover ceremony, German Economics Minister Peter Altmaier spoke of a “very important milestone” and repeated the ambition for “the most innovative, sustainable and efficient batteries to come from Germany and Europe.” He added the new battery cell plant would secure around 2,000 jobs and, in future, produce battery cells for around 500,000 electric vehicles annually. “With batteries made in Germany, we secure the added value and jobs of tomorrow!” Altmaier said.

ACC CEO Yann Vincent sees an important step in the company’s still young history. “This vote of confidence from the German authorities reinforces our ambition to become a European leader in the development and manufacture of batteries for electric vehicles and to enable clean and affordable mobility for all,” Vincent said. “The agreement signed with the German government reflects this ambition.”

The first phase of construction will lead to 8 GWh output and is scheduled to start in 2023. Battery production in Kaiserslautern is expected to begin in 2025, according to Ralph Wangemann, Opel’s Managing Director of HR and Labour. Subsequently, two more blocks with eight GWh each are to be built to reach the targeted production of 24 GWh.

On Linkedin, however, ACC mentions a second “gigafactory”, the one in France, set to start producing battery cells in 2024, in line with a previous target. The company added that the second plant “should allow us to reach our production objective of 48GWh by the end of 2028.” We assume this is the total production.

Back in Germany, the BMWi announced all five approved projects from the first battery IPCEI have started. For the second battery IPCEI that saw Tesla competing as well, six of eleven projects are underway. These are also expected to receive funding notices “in the coming weeks,” the ministry said.
