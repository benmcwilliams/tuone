There’s one in Ohio, one in Tennessee, and one in Michigan.\n\nGM and LG have been working on a fourth US battery factory, but it was reported in January that the plan for a new battery plant in the US is on hold “indefinitely” after talks between GM and LG failed to move forward.\n\nGM now partners with Samsung SDI\n\nNow GM is announcing a partnership with Samsung SDI to build a new battery cell factory in the US:\n\nGeneral Motors Co. and Samsung SDI announced today they plan to invest more than $3 billion to build a new battery cell manufacturing plant in the United States that is targeted to begin operations in 2026.\n\nIn a press release, GM announced that the new factory will have a capacity of “more than 30 GWh” and it will bring GM’s total capacity in the US to about 160 GWh.\n\nInterestingly, GM and Samsung are talking about building production lines to build both “nickel-rich prismatic and cylindrical cells.”\n\nDoug Parks, GM executive vice president, Global Product Development, Purchasing and Supply Chain, commented:\n\nWe will continue to scale production and optimize the chemistry of our pouch cells for performance, range and cost using new approaches pioneered at GM’s Wallace Battery Center and by our technology partners. The introduction of new cell form factors will allow us to expand into even more segments more quickly and integrate cells directly into battery packs to reduce weight, complexity and costs. With multiple strong cell partners, we can scale our EV business faster than we could going it alone.\n\nGM and Samsung SDI are not ready to disclose where in the US the new factory will be located.\n\nElectrek’s Take\n\nIt’s an interesting development. GM seemed to have one of the strongest battery cell partnerships in the US with LG Energy through its Ultium Cells joint venture.\n\nThat partnership was certainly shaken by the Bolt EV battery recall, but it seemed to still be going strong. And it might still be going strong.\n\nThis might be just a smart move from GM to diversify its battery cell supply chain.'}...
Article 2: {'title': 'General Motors and Samsung SDI Plan to Invest More than $3 Billion to Expand U.S. Battery Cell Manufacturing', 'published_date': 'None', 'keywords': [], 'text': 'DETROIT and SEOUL, South Korea, April 25, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- General Motors Co. (NYSE: GM) and Samsung SDI announced today they plan to invest more than $3 billion to build a new battery cell manufacturing plant in the United States that is targeted to begin operations in 2026.\n\n"GM\'s supply chain strategy for EVs is focused on scalability, resiliency, sustainability and cost-competitiveness. Our new relationship with Samsung SDI will help us achieve all these objectives," said GM Chair and CEO Mary Barra. "The cells we will build together will help us scale our EV capacity in North America well beyond 1 million units annually."\n\n"It is a great pleasure to take the very first step to create a long-term industry-leading partnership with GM in the U.S. EV market," remarked Samsung SDI President and CEO Yoon-ho Choi. "We will do our best to provide the products featuring the highest levels of safety and quality produced with our unrivalled technologies to help GM strengthen its leadership in the EV market."\n\nThe plant will have more than 30 GWh of capacity and will bring GM\'s total U.S. battery cell capacity to about 160 GWh when it is at full production.\n\nThe companies plan to jointly operate the facility, and it is projected to have production lines to build nickel-rich prismatic and cylindrical cells.\n\nAccording to Doug Parks, GM executive vice president, Global Product Development, Purchasing and Supply Chain, the new joint venture with Samsung SDI will leverage the capital and technology of both companies to create new competitive advantages for GM.\n\n"We will continue to scale production and optimize the chemistry of our pouch cells for performance, range and cost using new approaches pioneered at GM\'s Wallace Battery Center and by our technology partners," he said. "The introduction of new cell form factors will allow us to expand into even more segments more quickly and integrate cells directly into battery packs to reduce weight, complexity and costs. With multiple strong cell partners, we can scale our EV business faster than we could going it alone."\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Ultium Platform was strategically designed to accept multiple cell form factors and chemistries. For example, in China, the Cadillac LYRIQ is powered by prismatic cells applied to the same battery packs used in the U.S.\n\nGM and Samsung SDI are not announcing the location of the plant or employment projections at this time, however, the number of new jobs in construction and operations are expected to number in the thousands. As customer demand for EVs rises, GM will continue to scale its supply chain and operations, including cell production and vehicle assembly.\n\nGeneral Motors (NYSE:GM) is a global company focused on advancing an all-electric future that is inclusive and accessible to all. At the heart of this strategy is the Ultium battery platform, which powers everything from mass-market to high-performance vehicles. General Motors, its subsidiaries and its joint venture entities sell vehicles under the Chevrolet, Buick, GMC, Cadillac, Baojun and Wuling brands.

Lee and Hyundai Motor Group Executive Chair Euisun Chung.\n\nExpected to start in 2026, the joint GM and Samsung SDI plant aims to have an annual production capacity of 30 gigawatt hours (GWh), the two companies said in a statement, adding that the location of the planned JV plant is not yet decided. The plant will produce high-nickle prismatic and cylindrical battery cells.\n\nReuters reported on Monday that they two companies were set to unveil their plans for joint EV battery plant in the United States as early as Tuesday.\n\nDetroit-based GM, like other automakers, is looking to diversify its battery supply chain and secure capacity of components to support its electrification goals as it attempts to catch up with Tesla Inc (TSLA.O).\n\n"With multiple strong cell partners, we can scale our EV business faster than we could going it alone," GM executive Doug Parks said.\n\nGM already has a joint venture (JV) in the U.S. with LG Energy Solution (373220.KS), and has been investing to ramp up cell production with the South Korean battery maker to take advantage of subsidies under the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act that aims to boost domestic manufacturing.\n\nThe U.S. Energy Department finalised a $2.5 billion loan to the GM-LG Energy JV late last year. The companies are building a $2.6 billion plant in Michigan, set to open in 2024, one of three JV Ultium Cells LLC plants.\n\nThey dropped plans for a fourth plant in New Carlisle, Indiana but GM could still pick the site for a battery plant with another partner, Reuters reported in January.\n\nGM said last year it expects to build 400,000 electric vehicles (EVs) in North America from 2022 through mid-2024 and increase capacity to 1 million units annually in North America in 2025. Sources say GM is considering if it will eventually need at least two additional EV plants to meet future EV demand.\n\nBiden, during a visit to Samsung in South Korea last year, urged companies to "enter into partnerships" with "American union members", saying JVs "that manufacture electric vehicle batteries would be made stronger by collective bargaining relationships" with U.S. unions.\n\nHyundai Motor Group and SK On, a battery unit of SK Innovation Co Ltd (096770.KS), plan to set up a battery JV in the U.S. state of Georgia, in an investment worth a combined about $4.86 billion, the two companies said on Tuesday.\n\nLast year, car maker Stellantis NV and Samsung SDI said they would invest more than $2.5 billion to build a new JV battery plant in Kokomo, Indiana.\n\nStellantis and LG Energy said in 2022 they would invest $4.1 billion for a JV battery plant in Canada.\n\nMost South Korean battery-related shares were down on Tuesday, with Samsung SDI shedding 3% as of 0407 GMT, versus a 1.8% drop in the broader market (.KS11).\n\nReporting by David Shepardson Editing by Chris Reese\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.'}...
