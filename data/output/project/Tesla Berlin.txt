Article 3: {'title': "Tesla's German Factory May Produce Motors Soon, Batteries In 2023", 'published_date': 'None', 'keywords': [], 'text': "Tesla has only been producing cars at one of its newest factories, Gigafactory Berlin, for less than a year now. However, according to people familiar with the matter, the US automaker already has plans to produce batteries in Brandenburg, and the project could begin in early 2023.\n\nIt comes as no surprise Tesla plans to produce batteries at as many of its global factories as possible, and we heard earlier rumors that EV batteries would likely eventually come out of Berlin, Germany. Tesla aims to do as much as it can in-house, and while we just recently learned that the automaker has secured enough contracts with other battery makers to more than satisfy its battery demand, for now, the company has made a reputation of investing in the future.\n\nWhether or not Tesla will actually produce batteries in Germany, and when it will happen for sure, are still unknown. However, reports suggest that it's bound to happen as soon as next year, since the factory is reportedly already in existence, and Tesla is currently working on its interior.\n\nTesla recently provided a battery technology presentation in Gr√ºnheide, where it discussed its various technologies and explained 4680 cells. According to a report in the German publication B.Z., folks from Tesla explained that the company no longer wants to install thousands of smaller lithium-ion batteries into its EV battery packs, but rather, a smaller number of bigger and thicker 4680 battery cells.\n\nThe 4680 cells are said to be faster and cheaper to produce, while also being better for the environment. We have learned, however, that Tesla is reportedly struggling to perfect and speed up the new manufacturing process. Once the process is streamlined, the automaker should be able to use it at various battery factories it opens across the globe.\n\nB.Z. reported that production at Tesla's upcoming battery factory at Giga Berlin is expected to begin in the first quarter of 2023. The factory aims to make enough batteries for some 500,000 Tesla models per year, which is about as many cars as the German factory will be capable of producing once it's at full capacity. At this point, Tesla is producing about 1,500 Model Y crossovers per week in Europe, so it still has plenty of work to do to get to some 10,000 per week.\n\nThe publication adds that Tesla will also start producing electric motors at the factory yet this year. However, to date, all batteries and powertrains have come from China.\n\nDo you think Tesla will begin to produce batteries at more of its factories across the globe? Is early 2023 just too optimistic for Giga Berlin to be manufacturing batteries? How quickly can Tesla ramp up vehicle production in Germany? Let us know all of your thoughts in the comment section below."}...

Among these is the facility‚Äôs battery production, which is reportedly expected to begin sometime in the first quarter of 2023.\n\nTesla‚Äôs next generation of vehicles is expected to be powered by the company‚Äôs next-generation 4680 cells. The company currently equips some Texas-made Model Y with 4680 batteries, but in the future, Tesla‚Äôs vehicle lineup is expected to adopt the new battery form factor. Gigafactory Berlin appears to be one site that is actively planning on equipping its vehicles with the new, larger batteries.\n\nAs noted in a B.Z. report, Tesla presented its 4680 battery technology in Grunheide this past Sunday. Tesla explained that instead of using thousands of small lithium-ion cells for its vehicles, the company intends to roll out cars that are equipped with significatly fewer but larger 4680 cells. The 4680 batteries are faster and cheaper to manufacture, and they are more environmentally friendly.\n\nTesla‚Äôs session appears to have attracted quite a lot of attention. On Sunday, about 1,000 visitors took the time to learn about the electric vehicle maker‚Äôs new battery technologies. Questions about training and jobs at Gigafactory Berlin were reportedly addressed as well.\n\n#Gigaberlinüá©üá™ rumours\n\n\n\nAcc to B.Z. information, battery production is to start "in the first quarter of 2023‚Äú\n\n\n\nFurther: Atm, the plant produces a good 1,500 a week\n\n\n\nMotor production is to begin in Gr√ºnheide as early as this yearhttps://t.co/S09fgRJbYz pic.twitter.com/iv4aj78XFA ‚Äî Berlinergy (@Berlinergy) September 12, 2022\n\nCiting information that it acquired, German news outlet B.Z. noted that the interior work for Gigafactory Berlin‚Äôs battery factory is already underway. Barring any unforeseen delays, 4680 battery production could begin ‚Äúin the first quarter of 2023.‚Äù The target is reportedly to produce enough batteries to support 500,000 Teslas per year, the estimated optimum output of Giga Berlin‚Äôs current state.\n\nGigafactory Berlin still has quite a long way to go before it is fully ramped. The facility is estimated to produce only about 1,500 Model Y per week for now, but eventually, this output is expected to increase to about 10,000 cars per week. Mastering the production of 4680 cells is an uphill journey as well, as the larger cells utilize a dry-coat electrode process, which is quite different from conventional battery-making techniques.\n\nDon‚Äôt hesitate to contact us with news tips.
