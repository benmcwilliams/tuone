SK Innovation subsidized for Hungarian battery plant,2021-07-20 00:00:00,"The South Korean battery cell manufacturer SK Innovation received a subsidy of 90 million euros from the Hungarian government for its second plant in the country. The prerequisite was that the EU Commission give the green light for the state aid, which has now happened.

SK Innovation says it is investing about 945 billion won in the construction of its second plant in Komárom – the equivalent of just under 700 million euros. SKI is now receiving the 90 million euro subsidy from the Hungarian state “regarding the anticipated positive effects on the local economy and employment from the operation of the second EV plant in Hungary”, as the battery manufacturer announced.

By way of background, the Commission, taking into account EU state aid rules and in particular Article 107(3c) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, may authorise member states to support the development of certain economic sectors “under certain conditions”. These economic sectors must be of common European interest.

In the case of SKI, the European Commission approved the Hungarian government’s subsidy plan after a ten-month review. “This is an exceptional case for the European Commission, which is known to be very strict about giving approvals, to grant such huge amount of subsidy to a Korean company in such a short period,” SK Innovation writes.

In June, the group division had already received a loan of 500 million US dollars from the Export-Import Bank of Korea for the same plant. The loan is a green loan fund, which SKI says it obtained on “favourable financial terms”. SK Innovation’s second battery cell plant will be built in the same way as the first plant in Komárom and is to have an annual capacity of 10 GWh. The plan is for construction to be completed this year and commercial production to begin in 2022. Earlier this year, SK Innovation also decided to build a third battery cell factory in Hungary, specifically in Iváncsa, 50 kilometres southwest of Budapest.

SKI currently only develops and produces pouch cells. As SK Innovation’s battery boss Jee Dong-seob recently confirmed at South Korea’s largest battery trade fair, Inter Battery, the company is also looking into the development and production of new types of battery cells, including cylindrical and prismatic cells. In this way, the South Korean company wants to expand their customer base. As is well known, Tesla relies on round cells in various formats, but the vehicles from the Giga Shanghai also use other cell types in some cases. While the pouch cell initially seemed to prevail among European carmakers, the VW Group’s new unit cell will be a prismatic cell.

At the beginning of July, SK Innovation announced its intention to expand its production capacities to a total of over 500 GWh by 2030 and to consider an IPO of the battery division. The expansion of the division is driven, among other things, by the high order backlog: according to SKI, there are orders for more than one TWh – i.e. 1,000 GWh. At the same time, the company currently has a production capacity of only 40 GWh per year.

According to SKI, the orders are worth 130 trillion won, which is equivalent to about 97 billion euros. These batteries are expected to be able to power about 14 million electric cars. “SK Innovation aims to become a global leader in EV battery market through aggressive investment,” Jee Dong-seob said, according to the latest announcement. “We will make consistent efforts to contribute to the development of local communities and EV market.”

SK Innovation To Build Third EV Battery Plant In Hungary,,"SK Innovation intends to build a third lithium-ion battery cell plant in Hungary. The company already operates a 7.5 GWh factory in Komarom and is building the second 10 GWh factory at the site.

The new, third factory willt be located in Ivancsa and produce up to 30 GWh of cells annually. The construction should start in the third quarter of this year, while the start of production is scheduled for early 2024. The plant should be fully completed by 2028. At this point, we are not sure what will be the final manufacturing capacity.

According to media reports, the initial investment in the new site will be 1.3 trillion won ($1.16 billion), but the total cost, by 2028, is expected at 2.6 trillion won ($2.3 billion).

SK Innovation supplies batteries to multiple global manufacturers, including Volkswagen, Ford and Hyundai. Hungary is in a great position to become a battery hub because multiple car factories are in a relatively close proximity.

However, probably the biggest factor in selecting the country for the investment is something else - subsidies. Bloomberg reports:

""Hungary plans to provide the biggest investment subsidy in its history, Szijjarto said, adding that the government would make the size of the aid public once the agreement was signed with SK Innovation and the process of notification with the EU has been completed.""

Hungary simply is willing to offer a high incentive to attract a plant that will have 2,500 direct jobs.

Currently, SK Innovation's total battery manufacturing capacity (globally) stands at about 40 GWh annually, but it's expected to increase several times over just a few years.

SK Innovation to build $859mn EV battery plant in Hungary,2020-05-19 10:01:28+00:00,"South Korean petroleum refining company SK Innovation announced today an investment of US$859mn in the construction of an electric vehicle (EV) battery plant in Komárom, Hungary. The facility, which the Budapest Business Journal reports will cover 112,000 square meters, will be the company’s second in the country.

In 2018, SK Innovation began construction of the first plant, which cost approximately $350mn. The original facility, also located in Komárom, has a capacity of 7.5GW per hour. Upon its completion in 2021, SK Innovation’s total global capacity is expected to include the No.1 Komarom plant (7.5GWh per year) and the new No.2 Komarom plant in Hungary, Changzhou plant in China (7.5GWh per year), Georgia plant in the U.S. (9.8GWh per year), in addition to the Seosan plant in Korea (4.7GWh per year).

The decision is part of SK Innovation’s initiative to strengthen its operations and presence in the European region. ""SK Innovation will be able to strengthen the position of our battery business in the European market by deciding to build a new plant as an expansion of our first plant in Europe,"" Kim Jun, CEO of SK Innovation, said. ""SK Innovation will become one of the best global EV battery producers by 2022 and raise the value of our company by obtaining production capacity to utilize our technological process.""

SK On receives funding for battery cell plant in Hungary,2022-03-23 00:00:00,"SK On, the battery division of the South Korean company SK Innovation spun off at the beginning of October 2021, can count on millions in funding for the construction of a third battery cell plant in Hungary. The EU Commission confirmed that it has approved state aid for this amounting to 209 million euros.

The plant is to be built in Iváncsa in the Közép-Dunántúl region. According to the information from the EU Commission’s communication, it will have an annual capacity of 30 GWh and provide at least 1,900 direct jobs. With this, the EU confirms the information provided by SK On when the plans for the plant were published in January 2021. According to the information at that time, the final expansion is to be reached in 2028.

SK On Hungary applied for aid in the amount mentioned in December 2021. The company itself will invest a total of €1.623 billion in the project, which started in early 2021. The subsidy will “contribute to the development of this area and the creation of jobs without unduly affecting competition”, as the EU Commission justifies its decision.

For SK On, Iváncsa is already the third battery factory in Hungary. The Korean company has been operating a factory in Komárom for several years. The second factory, for which funding was approved in summer 2021, is also being built at this location.

What kind of cells SK On will produce in Iváncsa is open. So far, the manufacturer has specialised in pouch cells with NMC chemistry. According to information from the end of October 2021, SK On is also developing LFP batteries for electric vehicles. The cheaper and more stable batteries are receiving increasing attention, partly due to the continuing rise in the price of base materials such as cobalt. At the time, the company expected its battery business to be profitable this year.

SK Innovation had officially completed the spin-off of its battery business on 1 October 2021. The now-independent battery division of the South Korean company is headed by Jee Dong-seob.
