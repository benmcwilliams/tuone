SVOLT confirms 2nd battery cell plant in Germany,2022-09-10 00:00:00,"SVOLT has confirmed building another cell factory for the European battery industry in Germany. The new site at Lauchhammer, Brandenburg, is a former wind turbine plant owned by Vestas. The company aims to repurpose it fast, by early 2025.

This is to make up for the delays SVOLT is now facing in Saarland. The Chinese company has been planning to produce battery cells in central Europe for some time and had confirmed factories in the German state of Saarland in November 2020. SVOLT aims to make cells near the town of Überherrn, close to a battery assembly in Heusweiler, also Saarland. However, the new plans in Brandenburg come on the back of said delays at the Saarland sites. We will come to these later.

Yet there are other reasons for Lauchhammer. Brandenburg, the state that surrounds Berlin, lies along the region’s supply chain and battery life cycle. There is, for example, the chemical company BASF which entered a partnership with SVOLT for battery materials and recycling at the end of 2021. BASF is currently building a cathode material factory, including a recycling pilot plant, in Schwarzheide, less than 7 kilometres from Lauchhammer.

SVOLT is planning to start production in Brandenburg in early 2025, Maxim Hantsch-Kramskoj, VP of Sales & Marketing of SVOLT Europe, told journalists. The company targets an initial capacity of 16 GWh.

That sounds like construction will quick (and rushed). The former Vestas site is a so-called brownfield project. SVOLT says it took over the plant, including buildings and infrastructure, from the previous owner at the end of August and will now “repurpose the majority of the existing halls”. However, rebuilding measures and extension works will also be necessary and realised in the near future, so SVOLT. The company adds that it was developing a master plan including a detailed schedule for all modernisation and building measures.

SVOLT sites in Saarland facing delays

At the same time, the construction of the Saarland sites will take much longer than planned. According to the Saarbrücker Zeitung paper, Kramskoy does not expect SVOLT to produce battery cells in Überherrn before 2027 – that is four years later than initially announced.

Even though Heusweiler builds on an existing building like Brandenburg, there would also be delays at this second Saarland site for the assembly of modules and packs, the manager said. Production was supposed to start in the middle of this year with parts from other SVOLT plants. Now the company says it will only begin assembly by February 2024.

Hantsch-Kramskoj did not detail the reasons for the delay but pointed to the project being “very complex”. Following experts, they would now reach master planning. The Saarland sites would get the time they require, he said.

SVOLT has to deliver, first from Brandenburg

Still, SVOLT has to deliver another driver for selecting the Lauchhammer site reasonably quickly. So far, PSA is confirmed as a customer and signed an option for 7 GWh as reported.

Kai-Uwe Wollenhaupt, President of SVOLT Europe & VP of SVOLT Energy Technology, said he was happy that they were able to conclude the conversations with Vestas timely and take over the site.

Mirko Buhr, Mayor of the City of Lauchhammer, also went on to “explicitly thank all those involved for their dedicated efforts to bring a successor company to the former Vestas site as swiftly as possible.”

The site offers 255,000 square metres of space, and SVOLT has the right of first refusal on an adjacent free area of another 71,000 sqm.

Hantsch-Kramskoj referred to the project as a “gigafactory” when speaking to the local press. Even if put in Tesla-speak, the new factory won’t compare to the Tesla plant in Grünheide, about 150 kilometres away.

As for synergies between the plants in Brandenburg and Saarland, SVOLT expects to utilise battery cells produced in Lauchhammer at the future assembly site in Heusweiler. At least until the Saarland cell factory comes online. SVOLT aims to produce between 22 and 32 Gwh, double the 16 GWh in Brandenburg. That is batteries for about 300,000 to 500,000 e-vehicles per year.

SVOLT has not disclosed which cells may be made in Brandenburg (and Saarland). However, the company has pushed cobalt-free battery cells since July 2019. These have undergone testing for at least two years now.

Plus, the battery maker that came out of Great Wall Motors reportedly produced a prototype batch of 20 Ah cells with a solid electrolyte based on sulphide only a few weeks ago in China. The prototype solid-state cells have an energy density of 350-400 Wh/kg. This is in line with SVOLT’s earlier tests, and the result promises a range of over 1,000 kilometres for electric cars in future.

"SVOLT builds additional battery cell factory in Brandenburg, Germany for European market",2022-09-12 00:00:00,"Frankfurt am Main / Lauchhammer, Germany, September 9, 2022 – Today, SVOLT Energy Technology Co., Ltd. (SVOLT), a global high-tech company with headquarters in China and with a European office in Frankfurt am Main, announced that it will build another battery cell factory for the European market in Lauchhammer (district of Oberspreewald-Lausitz in the German State of Brandenburg at a press conference with Dr. Dietmar Woidke, Minister-President of the State of Brandenburg, Prof. Dr.-Ing. Jörg Steinbach, Minister for Economic Affairs, Labour and Energy of the State of Brandenburg, and Mirko Buhr, Mayor of the City of Lauchhammer.

SVOLT is one of the global technology leaders for batteries and battery systems for electric vehicles as well as energy storage systems. After the planned site in the German State of Saarland with plants in Überherrn and Heusweiler, Lauchhammer in Brandenburg is the second announced SVOLT production site for battery cells in Germany. With its products, SVOLT aims to make a decisive contribution to the expansion of e-mobility and thereby to sustainable mobility overall.

Takeover of the former Vestas site in Lauchhammer

The Lauchhammer site is available at short notice as a so-called brownfield project. Vestas, a manufacturer of wind turbines, had only recently ceased production of rotor blades there. SVOLT has taken over the plant including buildings and infrastructure from the previous owner at the end of August. For the planned battery cell factory, the majority of the existing halls will be optimally repurposed. However, due to specific requirements of SVOLT, rebuilding measures and extension works are also necessary. These are to be realized in the near future. Currently, SVOLT is developing a master plan for the project including a detailed schedule as well as the necessary rebuilding, modernization and extension measures.

Local investment – Global build-up of production capacity

SVOLT is steadily expanding its global network of production sites as well as research and development locations. Battery factories are currently being established around the globe that will be among the most modern and sustainable in the world. The company ranks among the top 10 global manufacturers of vehicle batteries.

SVOLT strengthens e-mobility cluster in Brandenburg

The battery cells produced in Lauchhammer will be further processed for the use in electric vehicles, including at the future SVOLT site in Heusweiler, Saarland. Thus, SVOLT will benefit from synergies between the plants in Heusweiler and Lauchhammer. The plant in Lauchhammer therefore marks another milestone following the module and high-voltage storage production facility in Heusweiler, which is also currently being set up. In this way, the site in Lauchhammer also contributes to SVOLT’s ability to serve current customer projects in a timely manner and to achieve its expanded capacity targets in Europe sooner.

For its new project in Germany, SVOLT has deliberately chosen Brandenburg as an innovation hub. In recent years, an innovative hub for electromobility has emerged in the region around Lauchhammer and throughout Brandenburg. Numerous companies along the supply chain and the battery lifecycle are located in the region – in the immediate proximity, for example BASF, with whom SVOLT entered into a partnership for cooperating on battery materials and their recycling at the end of 2021.

As an independent automotive supplier, SVOLT focuses on innovative batteries and battery systems. SVOLT has comprehensive expertise in producing batteries efficiently, safely and economically, therefore increasing the ranges of electronic vehicles continuously. In this way, SVOLT makes a decisive contribution to the expansion of electromobility. Its completely cobalt-free battery cell (NMX cell), which SVOLT is the first manufacturer in the world to mass-produce, is not only significantly more sustainable, but also more cost-effective than classic nickel-cobalt-manganese battery cells.

Statements

Hongxin Yang, Chairman & CEO SVOLT Energy Technology: “The additional production site in Germany is an important milestone for the further expansion of SVOLT – in Europe, but also globally. I am looking forward to our planned battery factory contributing to the further expansion of sustainable electromobility in Europe. Both in Europe and in the Asia-Pacific region, we see a strong increase in demand for battery systems. The shift towards electromobility, but also government decisions, are driving demand for electric vehicles. SVOLT is responding to this market dynamic with steady expansion by building additional local capacities. Our sites close to our customers positively impact delivery routes and times – and thus the overall sustainability of electric vehicles.”

Kai-Uwe Wollenhaupt, President SVOLT Europe & Vice President SVOLT Energy Technology: “I am happy that we were able to conclude the conversations with Vestas timely and take over the site. For that, I would like to explicitly thank the management of Vestas and the local parties involved. With this additional site in Germany, we strengthen Brandenburg’s economy and the local battery production sector in Germany. We also make an active contribution to the Brandenburg e-mobility cluster and benefit from local supply chains and partners.”

Dr. Dietmar Woidke, Minister-President of the State of Brandenburg: “Good news in the midst of crisis-ridden times: The recently closed Vestas plant will start up again in the future. This investment fits in well with other e-mobility sites in Brandenburg. I am happy that SVOLT has recognized the potential of Brandenburg, the Lausitz region and the city of Lauchhammer and will set up here, further boosting structural development.”

Prof. Dr.-Ing. Jörg Steinbach, Minister for Economic Affairs, Labour and Energy of the State of Brandenburg: “This investment is a very good fit for the region, advancing the structural development in the Lausitz region with future-proof jobs and it is becoming increasingly apparent what an enormous attraction the region has for investors. I am also happy that SVOLT is giving Lauchhammer a new economic perspective with its site. For Brandenburg, this also means that the electromobility value chain is expended with yet another strong link.”

Mirko Buhr, Mayor of the City of Lauchhammer: “Lauchhammer has always been an important industrial and energy location. I would like to explicitly thank all those involved, in particular the Brandenburg Ministry of Economics and the engineering services provider GICON for their dedicated efforts to bring a successor company to the former Vestas site as swiftly as possible. I am convinced that SVOLT’s investment will not only maintain Lauchhammer’s tradition and status as a location for the energy sector, but that it will further strengthen it. The city of Lauchhammer will support SVOLT in providing optimal conditions for the production site and will always be a reliable point of contact.”

April 13 (Reuters) - Chinese battery maker SVOLT Energy Technology Co is set to expand its footprint in Europe to as many as five factories, Bloomberg News reported on Thursday.

SVOLT is looking at locations in eastern, northern and western Europe, with one larger site in the 20-gigawatt range, according to the report.

The company is targeting production capacity of at least 50 gigawatt-hours in Europe by the end of the decade, SVOLT Europe head Kai-Uwe Wollenhaupt said in an interview with Bloomberg.

The company in September last year unveiled plans to build an additional cell assembly in Germany to supply electric vehicles, picking the state of Brandenburg, which is also home to Tesla Inc's (TSLA.O) gigafactory, as a location.

SVOLT also plans to build a plant in Saarland.

Besides, SVOLT is in talks with several European car makers about battery cell supply agreements, the Bloomberg report said.

Asian companies dominate battery-making in Europe. Data shows some 44% of planned battery capacity in Europe by 2030 is expected from Asian companies, with Chinese battery giant CATL on top of the list.

SVOLT did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

Svolt to build another battery factory in Brandenburg,2022-09-15 13:51:39+02:00,"After the planned location in Saarland with plants in Überherrn and Heusweiler, Lauchhammer in Brandenburg is Svolt's second announced production site for battery cells in Germany. The company is one of the world's largest manufacturers of vehicle batteries. The site in Lauchhammer is available at short notice because wind turbine manufacturer Vestas only recently stopped producing rotor blades here.

Svolt has now acquired the plant, including buildings and infrastructure, from the previous owner. The majority of the existing halls will continue to be used in the best possible way for the construction of the battery cell factory. However, further conversion and expansion measures are necessary, which are now being carried out.

Svolt strengthens e-mobility cluster in Brandenburg

In future, Svolt intends to benefit from the synergies between the two plants in Heusweiler and Lauchhammer. The battery cells produced in Lauchhammer will be further processed at the future site in Heusweiler, Saarland, and prepared for use in e-vehicles. The group is relying on a completely cobalt-free battery cell (NMX cell).

SVOLT signs lease for battery factory in Germany,2022-12-12 00:00:00,"The Chinese battery manufacturer SVOLT has signed the lease for its future factory for the assembly of modules and packs at the Saarland site in Heusweiler. However, there is no mention of the future of the cell factory also planned in Saarland.

SVOLT itself says that the 15-year lease agreement underpins its long-term plans in Saarland. Parallel to the lease agreement, the company has also secured a possible right of first refusal.

The first part of the building (Production 1) is scheduled to go into use in April 2023, with the other parts of the building to follow in stages. The final completion is contractually agreed by mid-2024. SVOLT employees have already moved into the new administration building in Heusweiler.

In November 2020, SVOLT announced two projects in Saarland – on the one hand, the assembly of battery cells into modules and packs and, on the other hand, the headline-grabbing establishment of a 24 GWh cell factory in Überherrn. The statement at the time: in the former laminate park in Heusweiler – about 30 kilometres from Überherrn – operations were to start in mid-2022, in the cell factory at the end of 2023.

Cell production delayed in Germany

While according to the current announcement the delay for the assembly in Heusweiler will be less than one year, it is different for the cell factory: In September 2022 SVOLT had announced the construction of another battery factory in Brandenburg (planned production start is early 2025). In the course of this, it also became known that the construction of the cell factory in Saarland will be significantly delayed. Maxim Hantsch-Kramskoj, Vice President Sales & Marketing of SVOLT Europe, stated at the time that he did not expect cell production in Überherrn before 2027.

The assembly in Heusweiler will therefore not be carried out with locally manufactured cells, and a supply of battery cells from Lauchhammer in Brandenburg will also not be possible until 2025. Instead, cells from the Chinese SVOLT plants will probably be assembled into modules and packs there.

The plant in Heusweiler in the former ‘Laminate Park’ was converted by the Goldbeck company as a general contractor on behalf of the Batteriefabrik Heusweiler (PBH) project company. PBH is itself a spin-off of SHS-Strukturholding Saar. The aim is to continue to use the existing buildings on the site in the best possible way in terms of sustainability and to keep the conversion measures to a minimum. Thus, the centrally located building complex with a total area of around 23,000 square metres and the administration building will be retained. Some areas have been deconstructed to make room for new buildings with about 13,000 square metres as well as necessary logistics areas and outdoor facilities.

“With the signing of the lease agreement, we are underpinning our long-term plans in Saarland, which are a key element of SVOLT’s European expansion strategy,” says Kai-Uwe Wollenhaupt, President SVOLT Europe & Vice President SVOLT Energy Technology. “The plant in Heusweiler will be the first location in Europe to directly supply our customers with battery packs and modules. I would like to thank all the partners involved and am particularly pleased that the first employees have already been able to move into the office buildings in Eiweiler.”

Anke Rehlinger, Minister-President of the German state of Saarland, added: “Preserving existing jobs and creating new ones: That is the primary goal of the state government. The establishment of SVOLT will bring many new jobs and is a great opportunity for Saarland to play in the premier league of electromobility.”
