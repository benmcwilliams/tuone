French industrial company Verkor announces the selection of the port city of Dunkirk (Hauts de France) for the construction of its first Gigafactory for the development of low-carbon battery cells designed to support Europe’s net-zero goals.

First delivery of low-carbon high performance batteries for electric vehicles scheduled for July 2025 to be manufactured in Dunkirk

Manufacturing capacity to expand from 16 GWh in 2025 to 50 GWh by 2030.

The announcement marks a significant milestone for Verkor, founded in 2020, realising the company’s vision and accelerating its goals for battery development. Dunkirk is the most promising site out of the 40 investigated by Verkor in France, Spain and Italy. Spanning more than 150 hectares, the site will meet growing demand from European and international car manufacturers, as the roll-out of high-performance electric vehicles continues to gather pace across the continent.

The site meets all the requirements for a Gigafactory in terms of land, logistics, energy capacity, proximity to customers, access to a qualified workforce, and scalability. Up to 1,200 direct jobs and more than 3,000 indirect jobs are expected to be generated during the first phase of the project. The Verkor Gigafactory in Dunkirk will create a new ecosystem of players and solutions to support the development of Europe’s battery value chain. The high performance, low carbon batteries from Verkor’s site will contribute to the continued excellence and innovation of the French and European automotive industry.

Once operational, the Gigafactory will supply several customers, and most notably Renault Group after signing a strategic partnership with Verkor last summer.

Benoit Lemaignan, CEO of Verkor: “We are eager now to work with our partners to unite all the winning conditions to build the best battery-cell factory in the world. Dunkirk is the best choice among many other great opportunities, and I really want to thank all the people in the territories, as well as our partners including Groupe IDEC, who supported us in this process.”

Verkor and the French National Commission for Public Debate are now moving forward with the national consultation process for the site.

Agnès Pannier-Runacher, the French Minister of Industry: “Mastering the entire battery value chain is critical to the transition to electric mobility. I welcome this new important step by Verkor. Their choice of location reinforces “the electric battery valley” that is taking shape in the Hauts de France, as well as its dynamic ecosystem. It sends a positive signal to Dunkirk’s industrial platform, which has key assets in the sector. Verkor, like many players in the value chain, can rely on the Government’s ongoing support under the France 2030 plan.”

The construction of the Gigafactory is scheduled to begin in 2023. Research and development will continue to be based out of Grenoble where the construction of the Verkor Innovation Centre (VIC) is already under way. The innovations developed there will be a prelude to the manufacturing excellence of Verkor’s first Gigafactory.

Verkor starts construction of battery cell factory in Dunkirk,2023-11-17 00:00:00,"The plant will be built in the port of Dunkirk and is expected to contribute to the creation of around 1,200 direct and 3,000 indirect jobs. Expanding capacity from an initial 16 GWh to 50 GWh is planned by 2030. In September, Verkor received more than two billion euros in fresh capital, which will be used to construct the battery cell factory in Dunkirk and its research and development activities in Grenoble.

The primary customer for the battery cells will be the Renault Group. The car manufacturer entered into a strategic partnership with Verkor in 2021, converted into a commercial partnership, i.e. a binding supply contract, in April 2023. Together, the companies want to develop and manufacture high-performance batteries for Renault electric cars from the C segment upwards and for Alpine models. According to the announcement from the summer, Renault intends to purchase ten GWh from Verkor from 2026, and then 20 GWh from 2030.

Meanwhile, Verkor’s research and development is based in Grenoble. It is where the Verkor Innovation Centre (VIC) is located, which started operations at the end of June 2023.

“Dunkirk was not chosen by chance. We can feel the creative energy of all the players involved in this project, inspiring us, and pushing us forward! Today marks a decisive step for Verkor, of course, but also for the European energy transition and the reindustrialisation of France” says Benoit Lemaignan, CEO of Verkor.

And the Verkor site will deliver much more than just low-carbon batteries. “The laying of this foundation stone is a concrete expression of our determination to accelerate the decarbonisation of transport by building a resilient and sustainable European battery value chain,” Lemaignan adds.

Dunkirk is thus becoming an ever-larger battery hub. A battery cell factory from ProLogium, a battery recycling plant from Eramet and Suez, and a cathode material plant from XTC and Orano are also being built there – and Envision’s battery factory in Douai, which is currently under construction, is not far away either.

Verkor raises 2 billion euros for Dunkirk EV gigafactory,2023-09-14 00:00:00,"PARIS, Sept 14 (Reuters) - French battery startup Verkor said on Thursday it has secured more than 2 billion euros ($2.15 billion) in funding to build its gigafactory in Dunkirk, thanks mainly to a capital increase from investors including infrastructure funds and insurers.

The funding consists of 850 million euros in capital - the largest ever fundraise for a French tech start-up, according to a French government source - 600 million euros in loans from the European Investment Bank (EIB) and 650 million euros in state subsidies that await European Commission approval.

A co-founder of the Grenoble-based start-up told Reuters last week that Verkor was near to completing the first tranche of financing for the Dunkirk gigafactory, one of the four sites in ""battery valley"" in northern France.

The Verkor gigafactory should create 1,200 direct jobs and 3,000 indirect jobs, and start production in mid-2025. It will have an initial production capacity of 16 gigawatt hours (GWh) per year, including 12 for Renault (RENA.PA).

""This international funding strengthens our long-term prospects and ... we are now on track to become one of Europe's leading battery manufacturers,"" Verkor Managing Director Benoit Lemaignan said in a statement.

""This now puts us fully into action and allows us to realize the plan when we created the company three years ago,” Lemaignan told Reuters.

After the capital increase, Australian infrastructure fund Macquarie and French counterpart Meridiam will become Verkor's two main shareholders.

The funding increase also includes new investments from Fonds Strategique de Participations (FSP), an alliance of seven French insurance companies which holds stakes in innovative industrial players, and maritime transport group CMA CGM alongside existing shareholders such as Renault and Bpifrance.

Renault, an early supporter of Verkor, will see its stake diluted in this new phase to 10% from 24%. The French carmaker should retain a seat on the board of directors, said a source close to Renault.
