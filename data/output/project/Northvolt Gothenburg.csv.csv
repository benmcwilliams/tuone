Northvolt and Volvo Cars select Gothenburg for gigafactory,2022-02-04 05:26:23+00:00,"Volvo Cars and Northvolt have selected Gothenburg, Sweden, to establish a new battery manufacturing plant which will commence operations in 2025, create up to 3,000 jobs and complement the planned R&D centre that both companies announced in December as part of an investment of approximately SEK 30 billion.

The new plant and close ties with Northvolt will significantly strengthen Volvo Carsâ electrification strategy as the company aims to produce and sell only fully electric cars by 2030.

Construction of the plant will start in 2023 and it will produce state-of-the-art battery cells, specifically developed for use in next-generation pure electric Volvo and Polestar cars.

The plant will have a potential annual cell production capacity of up to 50 gigawatt hours (GWh), which would supply batteries for approximately half a million cars per year.

The Swedish location of the plant, which will be built in Torslanda, Gothenburg offers benefits in terms of a direct route into Volvo Carsâ largest car plant, access to infrastructure, a strong pipeline of renewable energy supply and relevant job competences, as well as its proximity to both Volvo Carsâ and Northvoltâs R&D units.

âOur battery cell partnership with Northvolt is key to our strategic ambitions in electrification,â said HÃ¥kan Samuelsson, Volvo Cars chief executive. âWe are committed to becoming a leader in the premium electric car segment and selling only pure electric vehicles by 2030.â

âEstablishing this gigafactory in Gothenburg is a decisive move, both to continue to transform one of the most dynamic automotive regions in the world, and to become the leading global supplier of sustainable batteriesâ, said Peter Carlsson, Co-Founder and CEO of Northvolt.

As sustainable production is a central tenet of the partnership between Volvo Cars and Northvolt, the plant will be powered by fossil-free energy with focus on driving renewable energy capacity in the region, and will integrate engineering solutions which prioritize circularity and resource efficiency.

Battery production for Volvo Carsâ and Polestarâs fully electric models represents a large part of each carâs total life cycle carbon emissions. By working with Northvolt, a leader in sustainable battery production, and producing batteries near its manufacturing facilities in Europe, Volvo Cars and Polestar can significantly reduce the environmental footprint attributable to battery sourcing and production for their future cars.

âOur new battery plant will support our ambition to have a fully climate neutral manufacturing network and secure a supply of high-quality batteries for years to come,â said Javier Varela, head of engineering and operations at Volvo Cars. âThrough our partnership with Northvolt we will also benefit greatly from an end-to-end battery value chain, from raw material to complete car, ensuring optimal integration in our cars.â

The battery cell production joint venture between Northvolt and Volvo Cars will be a significant player in European battery cell production and will represent one of the largest cell production units in Europe. Volvo Cars and Northvolt have appointed former Tesla executive Adrian Clarke to lead the production company.

The R&D centre, which will become operational in 2022, will create a few hundred jobs in Gothenburg and positions Volvo Cars as one of the few automotive brands to make battery cell development and production part of its end-to-end engineering capabilities.

The partnership between Volvo Cars and Northvolt will focus on developing tailor-made batteries and vehicle integration concepts that give Volvo and Polestar drivers what they want, such as long range and quick charging times. Establishing deep vertical integration of battery development and production is important for Volvo Cars and Polestar, since the battery represents the largest individual cost component in an electric car, as well as a major part of the carbon footprint.

Taken together, the new battery plant and R&D centre will need a range of competences and the joint venture company is therefore actively recruiting highly skilled engineers and team leaders to advance the project. Large scale recruitment of operators and technicians will begin late 2023.

Northvolt in 2022: where we stand,2022-03-29 10:37:13+00:00,"It is now plain to see that electric vehicles will come to occupy the majority share of new car sales in just a few decades time. Electric vehicle sales in the first quarter of 2021 rose by 140% compared to the same period in 2020. By 2030, this number is expected to be 15-25 times higher yet. Meanwhile, renewable energy has become the default option for new generating capacity in Europe.

The dynamics in play impact all corners of industry and society in an uncountable number of ways, but what is constant is widespread and tremendous demand for lithium-ion batteries.

Ten years ago, there was little conversation at all of Europe engaging in the enterprise of establishing its own battery industry to support this new industrial revolution. Today, that domestic battery industry is taking root â valued in excess of â¬250 billion by 2025 and a regular talking point of European politicians and automotive leaders alike.

Already today, itâs almost inconceivable to imagine that at one time Europe never considered moving in the direction itâs now taking, such is how quickly the battery industry has emerged into the fabric of new European industry.

Establishing a new, sustainable battery industry for Europe from a blank slate, as is Northvoltâs mission, was always going to be a monumental task. But the progress to date speaks volumes for the momentum for systemic change exhibited by industry amidst the climate crisis.",https://northvolt.com/articles/northvolt-2022-where-we-stand/

Volvo and Northvolt start building battery cell factory in Gothenburg,2023-09-28 00:00:00,"Volvo Cars and Northvolt announced the joint battery cell factory in February 2022 and received building permission from the Swedish Land and Environment Court this summer. In August, the city planning committee in Gothenburg also granted building permits for the first construction phase. The corresponding building will contain the first production line and be commissioned at the end of 2026.

The future operator of the plant will be the Volvo-Northvolt joint venture called Novo Energy. To kick off construction work, the stakeholders met for a groundbreaking ceremony. Work on the construction site will not officially begin for a few days, specifically on 1 October. Still, preparatory projects are already underway, for example, for the later cooling and power supply of the plant.

“It’s a great day for us, a real milestone. We are grateful to everyone who contributes in different ways. The know-how and innovation that exists here in Gothenburg is fantastic. We have been able to grow to 200 people in a short time, but we need to continue to grow rapidly, and scale up as our entire industry grows,” says Adrian Clarke, CEO of Novo Energy.

The factory has a potential annual capacity of up to 50 GWh and is expected to employ more than 3,000 people when completed. For Sweden, the Novo plant is the second battery cell production facility after Northolt’s plant in Skellefteå. Volvo Cars and Northvolt first announced plans for the plant in the Gothenburg district of Torslanda, near Volvo’s vehicle plant there, in February 2022. At the time, the aim was to have the plant up and running by 2025. In the meantime, Novo assumes that it will be 2026.",https://www.electrive.com/2023/09/28/volvo-and-northvolt-start-building-battery-cell-factory-in-gothenburg/
Northvolt to build third gigafactory in northern Germany,2022-03-15 06:11:47+00:00,"Northvolt signs Memorandum of Understanding with the north German state of Schleswig-Holstein and the region of Heide for the development of a 60 GWh lithium-ion battery manufacturing plant

The gigafactory, Northvolt Drei, is to employ 3,000 persons and produce its first batteries in late 2025

Powered by the cleanest electricity grid in Germany, Northvolt Drei is positioned to produce the cleanest batteries in continental Europe

Stockholm/Heide â Today Northvolt announces its intention to establish a battery gigafactory in Heide, Schleswig-Holstein, northern Germany. With an annual potential production capacity of 60 GWh, Northvolt Drei will deliver a supply of sustainably produced lithium-ion batteries to the European market, sufficient for some one million electric vehicles.

The new gigafactory increases Northvoltâs pipeline of battery manufacturing capacity under development to over 170 GWh, thereby advancing the company on its mission to deliver batteries in a manner characterized by clean energy and circularity that is fundamentally different from approaches dominating the global industry today.

Peter Carlsson, Co-Founder and CEO of Northvolt, comments: âWeâre excited to announce Northvolt Drei â a project which fits well into a promising future cluster of clean technology ventures emerging in northern Germany and advances the wider European transition towards a sustainable society within which Germany plays a crucial role.â

Envisioned to produce its first batteries in 2025 and provide some 3,000 new jobs, a central intention of Northvolt Drei is to deliver high-performance lithium-ion batteries, produced with the lowest environmental footprint in continental Europe.

The selection of Heide, Schleswig-Holstein, is key to fulfilment of this objective. The region hosts the cleanest energy grid in Germany, one which is characterized by a surplus of electricity generated by onshore and offshore wind power and reinforced by clean energy provided through grid interconnections to Denmark and Norway.

âIt matters how we produce a battery cell. If you use coal in your production, you embed a fair amount of CO2 into your battery, but if we use clean energy, we can build a very sustainable product. Our philosophy is that new energy-intensive industries, such as battery manufacturing, should be established in actual geographical proximity to where the clean energy is produced,â says Peter Carlsson.

It is not only an abundance of clean energy which positions the region of Heide and broader industrial landscape surrounding Hamburg as ideally suited to hosting Northvoltâs expanding presence in Europe.

In addition to being centrally positioned in the emerging European battery supply chain connecting Scandinavia and continental Europe, the region also provides the space required to establish a battery plant of sufficient size to leverage the economies of scale in production which are key to reducing battery costs.

Access to German industrial competence and automotive expertise will provide additional opportunities. Local manufacturing expertise of the Schleswig-Holstein region and Heide will ensure the factory is delivering batteries of the highest quality, while the factory itself will provide critical labor force experience with battery technology â an emerging cornerstone technology of the European economy.

With sustainability at the forefront of design and decision-making surrounding Northvolt Drei, the factory will source significant volumes of its raw material requirements from recycled battery metals, as part of Northvoltâs commitment to source 50 percent of its raw material needs from recycling by 2030.

Alongside battery production, Northvolt Drei will target an on-site battery recycling plant which will ensure efficient reuse of byproducts from the production process and provide a sustainable solution for end-of-life electric vehicle batteries recovered from European markets.

Across the full scope of the project, Northvolt is eager to bring the companyâs commitment to transparency and straightforwardness into its dealings with external stakeholders. That approach has proven successful in Sweden, in Norway and in Poland, and there is every reason to believe it will underpin delivery of another project with Northvolt Drei.

Christofer Haux, interim CEO of Northvolt Drei, comments: âWe look forward to engaging with communities and authorities of Schleswig-Holstein to ensure that Northvolt Drei is developed in a transparent and collaborative manner that makes the most of the many opportunities the project represents for the region.â

Northvolt & Volvo to build battery plant in Gothenburg,2022-02-04 00:00:00,"Volvo Cars and Northvolt have announced the location of their planned joint battery cell factory: it will be built in Gothenburg, Sweden, from 2023 and is expected to be operational in 2025.

The factory will have a potential annual production capacity of up to 50 gigawatt-hours, according to both companies. This will enable Gothenburg to produce battery cells for around half a million electric cars per year. The cell factory will be built in the Torslanda district in the immediate vicinity of Volvo’s vehicle plant there.

The two partners did not disclose the exact amount of the investment in the cell factory. It is part of a total investment of 30 billion Swedish kronor, or about 2.9 billion euros. However, the sum also includes the construction of a joint research facility for batteries.

As Volvo states in the announcement, the Northvolt factory will not only supply the Torslanda plant, however, because the battery cells are to be installed in both Volvo-branded BEVs and Polestar vehicles – Polestar has so far manufactured its cars exclusively in China, while the Polestar 3 will soon be assembled at Volvo’s US plant in North Carolina.

The two partners do not give details of the battery cell in the announcement. A photo published to accompany the announcement shows a prismatic cell – but there is no information on the cell chemistry or its energy content.

The cell factory complements the research and development centre in Gothenburg announced as part of Volvo Cars’ joint venture, which is due to come on stream in 2022. “Our battery cell partnership with Northvolt is key to our strategic ambitions in electrification,” said Håkan Samuelsson, CEO of Volvo Cars. “We are committed to becoming a leader in the premium electric car segment and selling only pure electric vehicles by 2030.”

“Establishing this gigafactory in Gothenburg is a decisive move, both to continue to transform one of the most dynamic automotive regions in the world, and to become the leading global supplier of sustainable batteries,” says Peter Carlsson, co-founder and CEO of Northvolt.

For the young battery company, the factory in Gothenburg is another important step. Earlier this year, Northvolt announced that it had produced the first prismatic battery cell at its first factory, Northvolt Ett, in Skellefteå, Sweden, on 28 December.
