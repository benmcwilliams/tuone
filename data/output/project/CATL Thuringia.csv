CATL begins operations at new battery facility capable of producing one cell per second,2023-10-30,"CATL, the world’s largest battery maker, is now becoming the fastest as well, thanks to state-of-the-art production lines at its new battery base in China. The developer says its new assembly lines can produce a battery cell per second and an entire EV battery pack in under three minutes.

CATL remains the undisputed leader in EV battery development, not only in China, where it is headquartered, but around the world. Despite a slight drop in net profits in Q3 of this year, CATL looks like it will maintain its crown in 2024 as the largest shareholder in the battery market – a title it has already held for six straight years.

CATL’s share of over 30% of the entire market is no accident either. It continues to develop and produce some of the most advanced battery tech out there. Its energy-dense Qilin batteries have begun rolling out within ZEEKR EVs out of China, and we’ve even seen the company look to the skies by developing cells to support all-electric aviation.

The company has even introduced its own EV startup alongside Chinese tech company Huawei. In August, the company introduced a lithium-iron-phosphate (LFP) cell called ShenXing – capable of recouping 400km (249 miles) of range during a single 10-minute fast charge.

As CATL’s battery lineup continues to expand, so has its global production footprint. Just recently, the company began operations at a new production base in China, with assembly speeds that should help it keep a leg up on the competition.

CATL’s opens new highly automated battery base in China

According to a press release from CATL, operations commenced at the new battery facility located in the Guian New District of southwest China’s Guizhou province on October 27. The location is CATL’s latest home to power and energy storage battery production.

The 235+ acre site will eventually support two phases of the production base, the first of which is now complete and designed to deliver an annual production capacity of 30 GWh. CATL states that the first phase of the battery production base costs approximately RMB 7 billion ($957 million) and utilizes an advanced production line with an automation rate of 95%, delivering “a high production pace and high flexibility.”

Speaking of high pace, CATL relayed that the process from material feeding to a finished battery product is down to one cell per second and one entire battery pack in 2.5 minutes. When phase two is complete, CATL’s battery production capacity in Guizhou is expected to double to 60 GWh.

There is no timeline yet on when that next phase will begin construction.",https://electrek.co/2023/10/30/catl-begins-operations-new-battery-facility-producing-one-cell-per-second/
"CATL M3P Battery Production Begins, DOE Predicts 1000 GWh Of North America-Built Batteries By 2030",2023-03-26,"Sign up for daily news updates from CleanTechnica on email. Or follow us on Google News

The New York Times‘ motto is “All the news that’s fit to print.” Here at CleanTechnica, our motto is, “All the clean tech news that fits, we print.” There is a lot of EV battery news out there lately, so that will be the subject of today’s news blast.

CATL M3P Production

Last summer, we told our readers about a new battery chemistry from CATL, the world’s largest maker of lithium-ion batteries. Called M3P, the new batteries are said to be up to 15% more energy dense than LFP batteries, which would allow cars like the Tesla Model 3 to have a range in excess of 400 miles. Reuters reported last week that CATL is now ready to begin mass production of its M3P batteries. They will have greater energy density and perform better than lithium-iron phosphate (LFP) batteries and be less expensive than nickel- and cobalt-based batteries, Zeng Yuqun told an online investor briefing on Friday.

It’s not always possible to get exact information on what precise battery chemistries are being used by manufacturers. Such details are a jealously guarded trade secret. We do know there is such a thing as an LMFP battery, which adds manganese to the mix. The M3P batteries, on the other hand, replace the iron currently used in LFP batteries with a mix of magnesium, zinc, and aluminum, according to Autoevolution. Official data shows the energy density of M3P batteries will be about 15% higher than that of the 210 Wh/kg of current LFP batteries, which should translate into a 10% range improvement over the current LFP-powered cars built at Giga Shanghai, according to Sina Tech.

Zeng also has something interesting to say about solid-state batteries, which are supposed to be the Holy Grail of battery technology. The hope is that they will permit faster charging times while eliminating the possibility of battery fires that plague batteries made with semi-liquid — and flammable — materials. Toyota is pinning its hopes for joining the EV revolution on them, and Volkswagen has made a major investment in QuantumScape, a US company that is struggling to make solid-state batteries that are commercially viable.

Zeng told investors his company is finding it difficult to come up with a technologically feasible and competitive product based on solid-state battery technology. That’s not surprising. StoreDot also is working on bringing solid-state batteries to market but said last fall that it is at least a decade away from commercial production.

US DOE Battery Projections

The US Department Of Energy (DOE) said recently it expects US battery production in 2030 will be 20 times what it was in 2021. “A wave of new planned electric vehicle battery plants will increase North America’s battery manufacturing capacity from 55 Gigawatt-hours per year in 2021 to nearly 1,000 GWh/year by 2030. Most of the announced battery plant projects are scheduled to begin production between 2025 and 2030. By 2030, this production capacity will be capable of supporting the manufacture of roughly 10 to 13 million all electric vehicles per year.” And some people still believe the EV revolution is not happening!

“To optimize supply chain logistics, many battery plants will be co-located with automotive plants. Most of the planned projects in the United States are concentrated along a north-south band from Michigan to Alabama. Based on current plans, Kentucky, Tennessee, Georgia, and Michigan will see the highest growth in battery manufacturing capacity.”

The prediction by DOE was prescient. Thanks in large part to the financial incentives provided by the Inflation Reduction Act, investments in battery factories are flooding into America. This week, LG Energy Solution announced what it says is the largest investment — $5.5 billion — in a US battery factory ever in Queen Creek, Arizona, which is southeast of Phoenix. The company says the new manufacturing facility will consist of two factories — one for cylindrical batteries for electric vehicles and another for lithium-iron-phosphate pouch-type batteries for energy storage systems. The production capacity for cylindrical cells will be four times greater than what the company expected when it first considered a new factory in Arizona a year ago.

Together, the two factories will produce 43 GWh of batteries annually — 27 GWh of cylindrical cells and 16 GWh of pouch cells. LG Energy Solution says the LFP factory will be the largest in the US dedicated to producing batteries solely for the energy storage market. Groundbreaking for the new manufacturing complex will take place later this year.

With the new battery factory in Arizona, LGES will boost its production capacity in major product segments, develop more cohesive partnerships with its customers in both EV and ESS sectors, and cut back on the logistics cost by bringing its new manufacturing facilities in close proximity to its customers.

Situating the new ESS battery facility in North America, the biggest ESS market globally, LGES aims to respond to the fast growing needs for locally manufactured batteries on the back of the IRA and further expedite clean energy transition in North America, the company says. It acknowledges that the size of its investment was very much influenced by the incentives made available by the IRA.

“Our decision to invest in Arizona demonstrates our strategic initiative to continue expanding our global production network, which is already the largest in the world, to further advance our innovative and top-quality products in scale and with speed,” said Youngsoo Kwon, CEO of LG Energy Solution. “We believe it’s the right move at the right time in order to empower clean energy transition in the U.S.”

The company’s new manufacturing facilities will utilize a state-of-the-art smart factory system that carries out all decision making on machine-produced data. By implementing this key measure to enhance product quality, the Arizona facilities will aim to increase yield, improve manufacturing processes, and boost productivity to better respond to the rising battery demands in the region.

The Takeaway

The Inflation Reduction Act has opened the floodgates for new investments in manufacturing in America. It may succeed far beyond anyone’s wildest dreams at reshoring (that’s the magic buzzword of the year) jobs for Americans. At the same time, one has to wonder what kinds of batteries will be manufactured in all those new factories — NMC? LFP? LMFP? M3P? The battery industry is changing so rapidly there is a real possibility some of the batteries produced will be functionally obsolete before they get loaded onto pallets and shipped off to end users.

For EV and energy storage fans, it’s all good news, but we can foresee some of these new investments ending in tears for companies that decide to back the wrong horse in the battery technology sweepstakes. There are so many new developments coming, including sodium-ion batteries, that it would be easy for a company to find itself manufacturing battery cells that nobody wants.

CATL: Staying on top of the battery game,2023-12-01,"Last year, CATL produced 37% of the world’s EV batteries and 43.4% of energy storage batteries for a grand total of 289 GWh and 2023 is shaping to be another landmark year.

According to South Korean research firm SNE Research, CATL cemented its domination of the global EV industry in the January-August period this year with 37% market share, followed by second-ranked BYD with 16%. Its sales outside of China reached 27.7%, up by 6.9% year-on-year.

As pv magazine learned from CATL, in the third quarter of 2023, the company’s battery sales volume stood at around 100 GWh, with BESS accounting for nearly 20%.

According to CATL, innovation is the key driver of its growth. In the first three quarters of 2023, CATL invested about 14.88 billion yuan ($2.1 billion) in R&D.

As of the first half of 2023, CATL’s issued and pending patents have reached 22,039 worldwide, and it has contributed to the drafting or amending of over 110 industry standards at home and abroad.

With R&D centers in Ningde, Liyang, Shanghai, Xiamen and Munich, which employ more than 17,998, CATL is managing to stay at the forefront of development in energy storage technologies.

Some of its key breakthroughs include the development of liquid-cooling energy storage solutions with long service life and high level of safety.

pv magazine roundtables Europe 2023 Session 8 | Dec 6, 10:30 am CET, virtual | All about storage: Price, materials, tech, and new revenue As the energy storage sector continues to grow and mature, understanding costs and revenue opportunities is the highest priority for many stakeholders.

Furthermore, CATL has worked on low lithium consumption anode, which reduces the consumption of active lithium content while improving the stability of the anode material surface and structure as well as self-repairing electrolyte, which improves cell storage and cycling performance.

It has also achived big results with its passivated cathode with the help of doping and coating techniques to reduce side reactions in high-voltage scenarios.

As CATL underlines, “ensuring the safety of energy storage batteries poses far greater challenges than those for EV batteries, as it requires a much higher level of consistency in manufacturing as well as innovation in cell and system design.”

By deploying advanced technologies including 5G, flexible automation and IoT, CATL has achieved a defect rate of DPPB (single defect rate per billion) for its cells, which is the top in the industry.

As for the next frontier in development of lithium-iron-phosphate (LFP) batteries, today's leading energy storage technology, CATL’s goal is further optimization of product performance including service life, power rating, and direct current resistance (DCR), which will in return pave the way to more competitive batteries for its customers.

In terms of cycle life, CATL has already made and deployed batteries capable of cycling 12,000 times. In 2020, CATL deployed the 12,000-cycle ultra-long-life batteries at the Jinjiang 100 MWh Energy Storage Power Station, which has been operating safely ever since, according to the company. CATL’s stated goal is to increase the cycle life to 18,000 cycles.

Beyond lithium-ion stationary storage technology, CATL is also at the forefront of development of the sodium-ion chemistry. It sees the technology as compatible and complementary to lithium-ion batteries.

CATL says it has successfully built the basic industry chain for sodium-ion batteries and established the mass production capacity, noting that the production volume and shipment scale depend on the implementation of customers’ projects.

According to CATL, there are still many conditions that need to be met in the market before the large-scale commercial application of sodium-ion technology. “We hope that the whole industry will work together to promote the development of sodium-ion batteries,” company representatives say.

In 2021, CATL rolled out its first generation sodium-ion battery with an energy density of 160 Wh/kg and promised an increase to 200 Wh/kg for the next generation. In April, it confirmed that Chinese Chery will become the first automaker to use its sodium-ion battery tech.

This year, CATL has also signalled that it is setting a foot into the emerging field of long-duration energy storage. In November, the manufacturer announced a 10 GWh supply deal inked with Australian renewable energy investor Quinbrook, which will initially involve the delivery of 1 GWh of CATL’s latest outdoor container LFP solution called EnerC Plus.

It also said that the partners will work closely together to assess the viability of “CATL's groundbreaking 8hr charge and 16hr discharge energy storage solution” for use on the Sun Cable Project located in Australia's Northern Territory, which is expected to include up to 20 GW of solar and up to 42 GWh of battery storage.

In the EV sphere, CATL’s major announcement this year was the development of the “condensed matter” battery, a type of semi-solid state product with condensed electrolyte and new anode and separator materials, will have an energy density of up to 500 Wh/kg.

This was preceeded by the launch of Qilin battery in 2022, the third generation of its cell-to-pack technology, claiming the highest integration level to date. With a record-breaking volume utilization efficiency of 72% and an energy density of up to 255 Wh/kg, Qilin is capable of delivering a range of over 1,000 km and equating to a five-minute hot start and ten minutes of charging to get from 10-80% state of charge.",https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/12/01/catl-staying-on-top-of-the-battery-game/
CATL Starts Series Production Of EV Battery Cells In Germany,,"Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Limited (CATL), the world's largest electric vehicle battery manufacturer, announced that its new lithium-ion battery cell plant in Germany started series production ""as scheduled"".

The Contemporary Amperex Technology Thuringia GmbH (CATT) in Thuringia is the company's first factory outside of China. It was announced in 2018 as part of a business deal with BMW Group.

Construction of the site started in 2019. In Q3 2021, the G1 facility began production of battery modules (one module might consist of multiple cells), while the new G2 battery cell facility received approval in April 2022 and this month it came online.

The initial manufacturing capacity is estimated at 8 Gigawatt hour per year, although in the future, it's expected to reach 14 GWh per year. According to CATL, at a total investment of up to $1.9 billion (€1.8 billion) up to 2,000 new jobs will be created in Germany.

Matthias Zentgraf, CATL's president for Europe said:

""The production kickoff proves that we kept our promise to our customers as a reliable partner of the industry and we stay committed to Europe's e-mobility transition even under very challenging conditions like the pandemic. We are working hard to ramp up production to full capacity, which is our top priority for the coming year.""

The company does not elaborate on the cell form factor or battery chemistry, but we guess that it's the prismatic form factor.

CATL is currently investing an even higher amount - $7.8 billion (€1.8 billion) - in a much larger battery plant project in Hungary, which is set for 100 GWh of batteries annually. This new factory will produce battery cells for various plug-in car manufacturers, including the all-new cylindrical battery cells for BMW Group.

Globally, CATL is the largest battery supplier for electric cars with a 33% market share as of the first half of 2022 and an average output of well over 10 GWh per month. The company produces LFP-, NCM- and other battery chemistries, as well as battery system solutions, including cell-to-pack systems, which eliminates the necessity of modules inside the battery pack enclosure.

Currently, the company is considering whether one of its new plants will be built in North America.",https://insideevs.com/news/628393/catl-started-production-battery-cells-germany/
CATL launches cell production in new 60 GWh factory,2021-12-22,"The Chinese battery cell manufacturer CATL has started production at its largest plant to date in Fuding near Ningde in Fujian province, which is to offer an annual capacity of 120 GWh when completed. The first phase, which has now started, is said to have a capacity of 60 GWh per year.

The Fuding plant is CATL’s largest single project to date. To illustrate the scale: This battery factory alone has a planned capacity almost equal to the total installed capacity of all battery cell manufacturers in China in the first eleven months of 2021 – which was 128.3 GWh. According to current battery prices, 120 GWh would have a production value of over 100 billion yuan, or just under 14 billion euros.

CATL had announced a new plant in Ningde in February 2020, which it said at the time would be completed within two years. The planned production capacity of the plant, which will cost up to 10 billion yuan (about 1.3 billion euros at the time), was not mentioned in 2020.

However, construction did not start until this year, Liu Henghua, operational manager of the project, said, according to a report in the Fujian Daily. “With the support of government departments at all levels, Fuding CATL took about 330 days from the piling of the plant to the commissioning of the first production line, achieving the start of construction to commissioning in the same year,” Liu said.

It is not clear from the reports how quickly full utilisation of the 60 GWh of the first phase will be achieved. According to the report, the first phase will include four cell plants, three module assemblies and “supporting facilities” such as warehouses and dormitories. The plant is expected to create a total of about 10,000 jobs.

In addition, on 19 December, CATL broke ground for the construction of another production facility in Xiamen in Fujian Province, which is to be completed in December 2024 with a capacity of around 20 GWh.

The company – like virtually all cell manufacturers – is on a huge expansion course. According to figures from the China Automotive Battery Innovation Alliance (CABIA), CATL had an installed production capacity of 11.45 GWh in China in November, giving it a market share of 55 per cent. However, the company has already announced its own plants and production facilities of joint ventures with carmakers, which add up to 600 GWh.

CATL reportedly vetting sites for US battery production to support BMW and Ford,2022-05-06,"A recent report states that global battery conglomerate CATL is in the final stages of vetting potential sites to bring EV battery production to the US. The move would mark the company’s first entry into the second largest automotive market in the world, and the new facilities would provide cells to BMW AG and Ford Motor Company for their EV production stateside.

Contemporary Amperex Technology Co Ltd., better known as CATL, is a global energy technology company and the leading EV battery manufacturer in China. Beyond Asia, the company has retained its crown as the world’s largest battery manufacturer by installed capacity for a fifth-straight year.

In addition to recent projects to implement battery recycling and net-zero carbon manufacturing facilities in China, CATL has begun to expand outside of its home country. Its first announcement came this past April with plans for an 8 GWh battery plant in Germany.

A week later, CATL announced a $6 billion investment to mine, manufacture, and recycle batteries in Indonesia, expanding its global reach further. According to the latest report, CATL plans to soon be manufacturing EV batteries in the US as well, and could be providing cells to US automakers assembling nearby.

Could CATL be making batteries in the US for Ford and BMW?

According to a report from Reuters, sources close to the matter say CATL is in the final stages of determining potential sites to set up US manufacturing. Two possible locations include South Carolina and Kentucky, where BMW AG and Ford Motor Company currently have assembly plants.

According to sources who asked not to be identified, talks are ongoing, but CATL would provide battery cells to both BMW and Ford from facilities erected near their respective assembly plants. One source elaborated, stating that CATL is looking to commence battery production for BMW in South Carolina by 2026.

In a statement, current CATL customer BMW shared it is “intensively examining the possibility of establishing a battery factory” in the US, as well as acquiring battery materials stateside. The company also said it is in talks with several partners regarding the factory.

Last September, Ford announced a massive EV production project called Blue Oval City in Tennessee, which included a battery plant with the help of SK Innovation. Additionally, the two parties shared plans for a second plant near Ford’s assembly facilities in Louisville, Kentucky.

With electric truck demand beginning to soar for the American automaker, additional battery cells in Tennessee or Louisville make sense. Considering Tennessee is where the electrified trucks are currently planned to be produced, a CATL plant feels like a better fit.

However, that isn’t to say Ford won’t refurbish its Kentucky plants currently assembling ICE vehicles like the Escape, Expedition, and F Series to support EVs, too, especially since it’s already building a battery plant there with SK. Ford declined to comment.

CATL’s expedited expansion to the US comes at an opportune time, following the Department Energy’s recent $3 billion program to support local battery manufacturing – part of the Biden administration’s larger $7.5 billion infrastructure bill approved last year.

CATL has declined to comment so far.",https://electrek.co/2022/05/06/catl-reportedly-vetting-sites-for-us-battery-production-to-support-bmw-and-ford/
