QuantumScape (QS) Q3 2023: prototype solid-state test cells exceed performance targets,2023-10-26,"Following the close of Q3 2023, solid-state battery developer QuantumScape has updated the public to its progress the last three months, which includes some encouraging results. In addition to catching a peep at mockups of its production-intent QSE-5 cell design, QuantumScape’s prototype has done better than expected with one automotive OEM in particular. Are solid-state EVs closer than we imagined? QuantumScape says maybe, but it still has some work to do.

If you don’t know the name QuantumScape ($QS) by now, you should probably start educating yourself (don’t worry, we have plenty of previous coverage for you to study). The advanced battery technology company has been working for over a decade to develop scalable, energy-dense solid-state battery cells that can one day achieve cost parity with traditional lithium-ion cells popular in current EV models.

While there are plenty of competitors out there chasing a future powered by safer and more efficient solid-state cells, QuantumScape hit its own major breakthrough in 2020 by utilizing a proprietary ceramic separator. This technology led to single-layer prototype cell testing, followed by 10-layer cells, then 16-layer prototypes.

By Q2 of 2022, QuantumScape’s solid-state had expanded to 24 layers, setting the stage for vigorous internal testing and the beginning of a three-step journey (A, B, and C prototype cells) before entering automotive qualification and (hopefully) commercialized production.

In December of 2022, QuantumScape began delivering the first 24-layer A0 prototype cells to automotive partners to test themselves, and by Q1 of 2023, testing had been completed by at least one unnamed EV OEM.

At that same time, QuantumScape shared that its first commercial solid-state product will be an ~5 Ah cell called QSE-5 (seen above), which also began shipping to OEM partners as of Q2 2023. Now, QuantumScape has posted its Q3 2023 report, and A0 prototype testing has delivered results that were better than expected.

QuantumScape rolls in Q3, shares FlexFrame format

As previously mentioned, QuantumScape’s first planned commercial product will be a solid-state cell called the QSE-5, based upon the aforementioned A0 prototype cells. QS states that the cell consists of a unique format it calls FlexFrame, which combines the conventional pouch and prismatic cell designs in order to address the “uniaxial expansion of lithium metal as it plates and strips during charging and discharging.”

The battery developer shared that a primary goal for 2023 is to improve the packaging of its QSE-5 cells compared to the A0 prototypes, as the former will contain higher-loading cathodes than the former, sustaining higher current densities built with tighter margins, putting more stress on the cell.

For comparison, QuantumScape says the QSE-5 cells are designed to deliver a capacity around 5 amp-hours (Ah), while 2170 battery designs currently used by some of the top EV automakers offer an average capacity of around 4.5–5 Ah. In this case, QuantumScape sits on the cusp of performance parity if not better, using smaller, lighter, and safer cells.

Switching back to the A0 prototypes that will enable the production of the QSE-5 cells someday, QuantumScape provided further room for optimism in its Q3 2023 report. The company states that although its commercial target for its solid-state cells remains at 80% energy retention through 800 charge cycles, one prospective automotive customer found much better results testing the A0 cells.

Those labs completed over 1,000 full cycle equivalents and achieved over 95% discharge energy retention using test conditions of C/3 charge and C/2 discharge with QuantumScape’s standard temperature and pressure conditions, and 100% depth of discharge. In the Q3 report, QuantumScape patted itself on the back for this encouraging result, but isn’t shopping for yachts any time soon – there is still plenty of room for improvement. Per the company:

We emphasize that this is the best-performing cell and we have work to do on aspects such as reliability. Nonetheless, this is an exceptional result. We are not aware of any automotive-format lithium-metal battery that has shown such high discharge energy retention over a comparable cycle count, at room temperature and modest pressure, regardless of C-rate. We believe that no competing electrolyte — solid or liquid — has demonstrated sufficient stability with lithium metal to achieve this, and that this result sets a new high-water mark for lithium-metal battery performance.

Looking ahead, QuantumScape states that its work beyond Q3 2023 will remain focused on QSE-5 development, which could find much success in several applications serving all vehicles from passenger EVs, to commercial trucks, motorcycles, and even consumer electronics. In regard to electronics, QuantumScape’s Q3 report states that the company’s single-layer solid-state cells have now achieved between 1,500 to 2,000 cycles with approximately 80% discharge energy retention with zero externally applied pressure. For comparison, QS states that 500 to 1,000 charge-discharge cycles represents the key life cycle threshold for most consumer electronics applications.

On the manufacturing side, QuantumScape has completed equipment installation for its “Raptor” fast separator heat treatment process (3x as fast as previous processes) and remains on track to deploy the process by year’s end. It also continues to make progress in implementing its “Cobra” process to support the QSE-5 B0 prototype production in the future.

Financials look good as well. The Q3 report detailed $1.1 billion in liquidity as QuantumScape raised $300 million in gross proceeds the past three months. The company’s current forecast offers enough runway to continue solid-state cell development into 2026. Per QuantumScape:

Our focus for 2023 is simple: turn the corner from prototype to product. Our key milestones are all aimed at advancing product development to build a sufficient level of technical and manufacturing maturity to enable initial production of QSE-5. With just a few months remaining in the year, we are maintaining aggressive near-term schedules and remain focused on bringing a potentially disruptive first product to market in the near future.

But strategically, our mission is bigger than a series of near-term objectives. We have been pursuing a next-generation electric vehicle battery for over a decade, and with a mission as challenging and as important as this, long-term thinking is indispensable. Moreover, the market opportunity for our technology platform is massive, potentially in the hundreds of billions of dollars annually for decades to come.",https://electrek.co/2023/10/26/quantumscape-qs-q3-2023-prototype-solid-state-cells-exceed-targets/
"Quantumscape Q2 2022 report: 24-layer solid-state cells, scaled manufacturing, and two new OEM customers",2022-08-01,"Solid-state battery manufacturer Quantumscape has released its second quarterly report for 2022, updating the public to its progress in scaling affordable, energy dense cells for future EVs. The company continues to expand the amount of layers possible in its solid-state cell technology, while simultaneously preparing for scaled assembly for a growing list of OEMs. Here’s the latest.

QuantumScape ($QS) is a battery technology company founded in 2010 with the goal of developing scalable, effective solid-state batteries that can (hopefully) reach cost parity with traditional lithium-ion cells.

Although it has been working for over a decade, the battery developer really started gaining momentum in 2020 when it announced it had reached a “major breakthrough” by utilizing a ceramic separator. This lead to the successful testing of single-layer prototype cells. After doubling the size of its initial pilot manufacturing line, Quantumscape revealed it had also developed 10-layer cells, followed by a 16-layer prototype.

This past February, QuantumScape shared another industry first with a single-layer cell that completed 400 consecutive 15-minute fast-charge cycles, replenishing from 10% to 80% capacity while still retaining over 80% of its initial energy.

Now, Quantumscape has revealed a 24-layer cell as well as a slew of other updates.

Quantumscape’s new cells mark start of automotive journey

Quantumscape has come right out of the gate swinging, announcing yet another layer to its solid-state battery cell development… eight more to be precise.

According to the Q2 2022 report, Quantumscape has successfully developed 24-layer prototype cells, which are already enduring testing. The new solid-state cell also represents a new design format. The company explains it best:

The 24-layer prototype cells we’ve made were packaged in a variety of formats, including early variants of the proprietary format we are developing, designed to accommodate the expansion and contraction characteristic of lithium-metal batteries during charge and discharge (resulting from plating and stripping of lithium metal). As part of our development work, we have built and tested many cells of varying layer counts in this new format, including some that have achieved over 600 cycles and are still cycling.

These first 24-layer prototype are labeled Sample A cells, representing the beginning of a three step journey toward automotive qualification and eventual production. Each major sampling stage (A,B, and C) will consist of several generations of maturing cell prototypes which will be delivered to OEMs for testing and validation.

When Sample A deliveries begin this year, Quantumscape expects about 18 months to pass before it can deliver Sample B cells using low-volume production processes. The company says it anticipates a similar timeframe between Sample B and Sample C prototype cells, and a number of factors within QS as well as its OEM customers can certainly influence those targeted timeframes.

Quality improvements and manufacturing scale-up

In the report, Quantumscape is touting a recent improvement to its separator manufacturing process – a change that results in higher uniformity than its current baseline process, which has already delivered industry-leading performance results (800 cycles under gold-standard testing conditions

and repeated 15-minute fast charging at 25 °C).

The company has also developed a second-generation catholyte, which is the ion conductor in the cathode of Quantumscape’s cells. It is expected to offer better low-pressure performance, improved low-temperature behavior, better high-rate support, and improved cell reliability compared to its first-generation.

This quarter, QS incorporated the second-generation catholyte into it baseline process, which will soon include the aforementioned improvements to the separator manufacturing process as well. Speaking of manufacturing processes, Quantumscape continues to expand.

Quantumscape expands manufacturing and customers

Last but not least, QS has shared an update to its ever-expanding manufacturing processes for solid-state cells. During Phase 1, the company has been working to improve the quality and consistency of separator production, but now looks to apply that same engineering strategy to the cells themselves in Phase 2:

As part of bringing Phase 2 online, this quarter we took delivery and completed qualification of several key tools. Notably, we have completed site acceptance testing on our first-generation automatic cell stacker, which automates the first step of the cell build process. This new tool is designed to improve throughput; a step that previously took more than five minutes can now be accomplished in approximately 30 seconds. Consistency is another benefit of automation; a properly configured and maintained piece of automated equipment can perform the same operation repeatedly with low variation from run to run, which can improve cell quality.

Quantumscape has achieved a peak of over 5,000 weekly separator film starts this quarter, but still has its sights set on achieving 8,000 weekly starts before year’s end.

Lastly, QS shared that it has been working closely with major investor Volkswagen Group, but has announced two additional sampling agreements with OEMs in the automotive space. Out of respect for those companies, QS has not shared who they are yet, but should in the future.

We do know the two additional OEMs bring Quantumscape’s total to six potential customers – all of which are “global top-10 manufacturers by revenue to premium performance and luxury automakers, encompassing both pure EV and conventional OEMs.”

Looking ahead, Quantumscape remains focused on delivering a 24-layer A sample to an automotive customer this year. That’s all for now, until next quarter!",https://electrek.co/2022/08/01/quantumscape-q2-2022/
QuantumScape Ships First 24-Layer Prototype Battery Cells to Automotive OEMs,,"SAN JOSE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- QuantumScape Corporation (NYSE:QS) today announced it has shipped its first 24-layer prototype lithium-metal battery cells to automotive OEMs for testing. Delivery of these cells, referred to as A0 samples, was the company’s key public milestone for the year, and achieving this goal represents an important step toward the commercialization of this technology.

With 24 layers, each comprising a solid-state separator, a cathode, and an in-situ-formed lithium-metal anode, these prototype cells have capacities in the multi-amp-hour range, a range the company believes is relevant for a variety of applications, including automotive and consumer electronics.

With these cells, the OEMs can start the testing process at their facilities and provide feedback on the performance of the cells. The company still has substantial work ahead to bring this technology to market, including improvements to the quality, consistency, and throughput of its production processes, and additional enhancements on the product side, such as increased cathode capacity loading and improved packaging efficiency. The company expects to deliver improvements on these fronts in subsequent generations of A, B, and C samples over the coming years.

“I’m proud of our team for all the effort and determination that went into achieving this milestone, especially in light of the challenges we encountered this year,” said Jagdeep Singh, CEO and co-founder of QuantumScape. “While this milestone brings us closer to our ultimate goal, there’s still a lot to do before this technology becomes a commercial product, and we now turn our attention to this important work.”

The A0 cells were built in QuantumScape’s new cell format, which was another important goal for the year. This new architecture is a hybrid between prismatic and pouch cells designed to support the uniaxial expansion and contraction of the lithium metal during charge and discharge. The company plans to host a virtual event in the new year to share more about this innovative new cell format. Details will be posted on QuantumScape’s website and social media accounts.

Advanced E.V. Batteries Move From Labs to Mass Production,2022-07-12,"Adding to the risk, the slump in tech stocks has stripped billions of dollars in value from battery companies that are traded publicly. It will not be as easy for them to raise the cash they need to build manufacturing operations and pay their staff. Most have little or no revenue because they have yet to begin selling a product.

QuantumScape was worth $54 billion on the stock market shortly after it went public in 2020. It was recently worth about $4 billion.

That has not stopped the company from forging ahead with a factory in San Jose that by 2024, if all goes well, will begin producing cells for sale. Automakers will use the factory’s output to test whether the batteries can withstand rough roads, cold snaps, heat waves and carwashes.

The automakers will also want to know if the batteries can be recharged hundreds of times without losing their ability to store electricity, whether they can survive a crash without bursting into flames and whether they can be manufactured cheaply.

It’s not certain that all the new technologies will live up to their inventors’ promises. Shorter charging times and longer range may come at the expense of battery life span, said David Deak, a former Tesla executive who is now a consultant on battery materials. “Most of these new material concepts bring huge performance metrics but compromise on something else,” Mr. Deak said.",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/12/business/electric-vehicle-batteries.html

"QuantumScape’s Q2 report reveals 10-layer solid-state battery, plus commercialization timeline",2021-07-27,"In a letter to shareholders recapping Q2 of 2021, solid-state battery manufacturer QuantumScape has offered some exciting updates surrounding its solid-state battery technology. In addition to making progress on its pre-pilot manufacturing facility, the company is also developing and testing multiple layered versions of its solid-state batteries as part of a timeline for scaled production in the next several years.

QuantumScape ($QS) is a solid-state battery manufacturer founded in 2010 with the goal of developing scalable, effective solid-state batteries.

In addition to millions of dollars of funding from major automakers like Volkswagen Group, QuantumScape went public in the fall of 2020 via a reverse SPAC merger with Kensington Capital Acquisition.

Last December, the battery developer announced a “major breakthrough” in its technology, by utilizing a ceramic separator, leading to successful testing of single-layer prototype cells.

This past March, we reported that QuantumScape was also seeking funding to double the size of its initial pilot manufacturing line.

Per today’s letter to shareholders, QuantumScape has made strides implementing the new pilot line, and has begun testing solid-state batteries well beyond the aforementioned single-layer prototypes.

Cycle Life testing of QuantumScape’s new 10-layer battery / Source: QuantumScape

QuantumScape is already testing 10-layer solid-state battery cells

In its quarterly letter to shareholders, QuantumScape has offered a glimpse behind its solid-state curtain with multiple progress updates.

The biggest news to come out of the report was the announcement of a 10-layer solid-state battery. Not only has the QuantumScape created this solid-state battery, but it has already begun testing it.

These cells, in the commercially relevant 70×85 mm form factor, are being tested at 1C and C/3 (one and three-hour charge and discharge) rates under our standard temperature (25 °C) and pressure (3.4 atmospheres), conditions we believe are relevant for automotive applications. While we need to produce and test many more such cells to collect data and statistics on their performance and reliability, this is an extremely important result, as it demonstrates we are able to make 10-layer cells with similar early capacity retention and cycling behavior to what we’ve shown for single- and four-layer cells.

QuantumScape set a goal to showcase these 10-layer solid-state batteries by the end of 2021, so it is ahead of schedule at this point. The company plans to continue to develop and improve these cells through 2021 and into next year, followed by test cells for electric vehicles from its QS-0 pre-pilot production line in 2023.

QuantumScape’s second-generation continuous-heat treatment tool being installed in the engineering line at its current facility.

Speaking of its pre-pilot line, QuantumScape has ordered already long-lead equipment for the 197,000 sq. ft. facility for which it signed a long-term lease this past April. Since the company’s cell design is anode free, assembly requires no metallic lithium. Instead, QuantumScape utilizes a ceramic separator:

From its inception, our ceramic separator was designed to be compatible with scalable manufacturing processes. The separator heat treatment step – critical in the production of any ceramic – is no exception. Today, we are in the process of installing high-volume continuous-flow heat treatment equipment, an important milestone on our path to industrialization.

QuantumScape’s current timeline for solid-state battery production

With multiple layer batteries being tested, and a QS-0 pilot line being assembled, QuantumScape appears closer than ever to producing scalable solid-state batteries. As you can see in the shared timeline above, full commercialization of its batteries remains years away, but QuantumScape has a seemingly realistic plan of attack.

The next big focus will be prototype sampling next year, before the QS-0 line manufactures solid-state battery cells that might actually be implemented in EVs in 2023.

Electrek‘s take

This is solid-state battery technology we’re talking about, so even though its QuantumScape, take things with a grain of salt.

That being said, QuantumScape has been, and still remains the most realistic of solid-state battery manufacturers, as it continues to deliver concrete evidence of its progress alongside huge strides in development.

Last December, the company was working on a single-layer cell. By spring, it had a four-layer version. Now, its already testing a 10-layer version. Regardless of whether the company hits the milestones on its shared timeline, you can’t argue the impressive rate of its progress.

An IPO and financial backing from VW can certainly help speed these things up, but QuantumScape still appears ahead of the solid-state pack when it comes to actually reaching a scalable battery cell.",https://electrek.co/2021/07/27/quantumscapes-q2-report-reveals-10-layer-solid-state-battery-plus-commercialization-timeline/
QuantumScape considers cell production in Salzgitter,2021-05-16,"QuantumScape could produce solid-state batteries in the German city of Salzgitter with Volkswagen in the future. According to an agreement between the two companies, the location for the planned pilot plant with VW is to be determined this year.

According to the US battery specialist, Salzgitter is currently being considered for the pilot plant location. The plant, called QS-1, will initially have a capacity of 1 GWh, which will later be successively expanded to a total capacity of 21 GWh for series production.

Despite the announcement by its cooperation partner, Volkswagen says that no final decision has yet been made on the construction of a pilot plant for solid fuel cells in Salzgitter. “This technology of the future can only be built up in Germany with state support – because without such support Salzgitter has little chance in European and international comparison,” says a VW spokesperson. “The final decision on further steps towards a solid fuel cell pilot plant will be made in the fourth quarter at the latest.”

At QuantumScape, things sound much more optimistic. “Our goal has been to bring our solid-state lithium-metal batteries to market as soon as possible,” says Jagdeep Singh, CEO and co-founder of QuantumScape. “This joint venture brings together QuantumScape’s core battery technology with Volkswagen’s deep understanding of high-volume, high-quality production, and maximizes our ability to bring this technology into industrial production.”

Although the agreement was officially with Volkswagen Group of America, the fact that the Salzgitter site is being considered makes it clear that the group’s headquarters in Wolfsburg is the driver behind the cooperation.

Salzgitter is already a very important location for Wolfsburg’s battery plans: it is home to the pilot production facility for battery cells that will open in 2019. This project was initially driven forward with their battery partner Northvolt. After the Wolfsburg company announced at Power Day in March just passed that it would develop Salzgitter into one of the six European battery factories, it became clear that VW is now pushing ahead with the project alone. Salzgitter is also home to the pilot recycling plant for battery materials that opened in January 2021.

In February, QuantumScape announced the construction of a pilot plant called QS-0 in San José, California. At the end of March, QuantumScape announced in a stock offering that it would build a pilot plant with VW. A few weeks later, Volkswagen invested a further $100 million in the battery specialist, as QuantumScape’s cells had met contractually agreed requirements.",https://www.electrive.com/2021/05/16/quantumscape-considers-cell-production-in-salzgitter/
