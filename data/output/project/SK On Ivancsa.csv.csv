SK Innovation plans 3rd European battery cell factory,2021-01-29 00:00:00,"SK Innovation has decided to build a third battery cell factory in Europe. Like the first two European production facilities for battery cells, the Korean company will set up shop in Hungary, specifically in Iváncsa, 50 kilometres southwest of Budapest.

The new plant will have an annual production capacity of 30 GWh, which, according to SK Innovation, will allow the supply of batteries for approximately 430,000 electric cars per year. Construction on a 70-hectare site in Iváncsa is scheduled to start in the third quarter of this year, but the plant will not be completed until 2028, by which time SKI expects to have invested the equivalent of almost 1.9 billion euros.

The third Hungarian plant will be considerably larger than the two production facilities located in Komárom in the Hungarian-Slovakian border region. One plant with a production capacity of 7.5 GWh is in operation there, the second with a planned 9.8 GWh is still under construction. It is unclear whether the South Korean company’s original plan to complete the factory in 2021 and start delivering cells to European car manufacturers on a large scale from 2022 can be kept in view of the health crisis.

In a recent statement, SKI stressed that it intends to increase its global production capacity to at least 125 GWh per year by 2025 and to “further secure” its production base in Europe given the important automotive market located there. The company says it expects battery demand in European markets to increase from 41 GWh to 256 GWh by 2025. With the three battery cell factories in Hungary, SKI is thus laying claim to a large piece of this pie. The group has already signed long-term supply contracts with European car manufacturers. VW, for example, chose the South Korean company as one of its cell suppliers in 2018.

Meanwhile, SK Innovation announced the prospect of new battery cells only a few weeks ago that would enable electric cars to cover a distance of 500 miles or 800 kilometres with two ten-minute quick-charge stops each. The South Korean manufacturer is also said to be close to a cathode production with higher nickel content.

SK On receives funding for battery cell plant in Hungary,2022-03-23 00:00:00,"SK On, the battery division of the South Korean company SK Innovation spun off at the beginning of October 2021, can count on millions in funding for the construction of a third battery cell plant in Hungary. The EU Commission confirmed that it has approved state aid for this amounting to 209 million euros.

The plant is to be built in Iváncsa in the Közép-Dunántúl region. According to the information from the EU Commission’s communication, it will have an annual capacity of 30 GWh and provide at least 1,900 direct jobs. With this, the EU confirms the information provided by SK On when the plans for the plant were published in January 2021. According to the information at that time, the final expansion is to be reached in 2028.

SK On Hungary applied for aid in the amount mentioned in December 2021. The company itself will invest a total of €1.623 billion in the project, which started in early 2021. The subsidy will “contribute to the development of this area and the creation of jobs without unduly affecting competition”, as the EU Commission justifies its decision.

For SK On, Iváncsa is already the third battery factory in Hungary. The Korean company has been operating a factory in Komárom for several years. The second factory, for which funding was approved in summer 2021, is also being built at this location.

What kind of cells SK On will produce in Iváncsa is open. So far, the manufacturer has specialised in pouch cells with NMC chemistry. According to information from the end of October 2021, SK On is also developing LFP batteries for electric vehicles. The cheaper and more stable batteries are receiving increasing attention, partly due to the continuing rise in the price of base materials such as cobalt. At the time, the company expected its battery business to be profitable this year.

SK Innovation had officially completed the spin-off of its battery business on 1 October 2021. The now-independent battery division of the South Korean company is headed by Jee Dong-seob.

SK Innovation To Build Third EV Battery Plant In Hungary,,"SK Innovation intends to build a third lithium-ion battery cell plant in Hungary. The company already operates a 7.5 GWh factory in Komarom and is building the second 10 GWh factory at the site.

The new, third factory willt be located in Ivancsa and produce up to 30 GWh of cells annually. The construction should start in the third quarter of this year, while the start of production is scheduled for early 2024. The plant should be fully completed by 2028. At this point, we are not sure what will be the final manufacturing capacity.

According to media reports, the initial investment in the new site will be 1.3 trillion won ($1.16 billion), but the total cost, by 2028, is expected at 2.6 trillion won ($2.3 billion).

SK Innovation supplies batteries to multiple global manufacturers, including Volkswagen, Ford and Hyundai. Hungary is in a great position to become a battery hub because multiple car factories are in a relatively close proximity.

However, probably the biggest factor in selecting the country for the investment is something else - subsidies. Bloomberg reports:

""Hungary plans to provide the biggest investment subsidy in its history, Szijjarto said, adding that the government would make the size of the aid public once the agreement was signed with SK Innovation and the process of notification with the EU has been completed.""

Hungary simply is willing to offer a high incentive to attract a plant that will have 2,500 direct jobs.

Currently, SK Innovation's total battery manufacturing capacity (globally) stands at about 40 GWh annually, but it's expected to increase several times over just a few years.

SK Battery Hungary is to build its Iváncsa plant based on the good experiences in Komárom,2021-03-26 00:00:00,"SK Innovation’s plant to be built in Iváncsa, announced at the end of January, is the South Korean group’s second investment in Hungary. The company, which has its roots in the oil industry, has increasingly turned to green energy solutions over the past decade and has developed innovative technologies for the production of batteries for electric cars.

SK Innovation established its first battery plant in South Korea and then built new plants in China.

To meet the growing needs of the European automotive industry, investment project was launched in Komárom in February 2018, followed by production start as early as autumn of 2019. Currently, 1,300 people work at SK Battery Hungary Kft., of various age groups, both men and women.

Although HR manager dr. Márton Ruppert initially expected difficulties due to the Komárom, Tatabánya and Győr region’s low unemployment rates, but thanks to the attractive wage and benefits offered by the company, together with the clean, modern work environment recruitment has been successful, with over 90 percent of employees living within 50 kilometers. The goal in the case of the Iváncsa plant is that the majority of the employees should be residents of Fejér County.

The company carries out its activities in possession of the necessary official permits (environmental protection permits, disaster protection permits) under the supervision of the relevant Hungarian authorities. Also, Komárom plant has regular emission measurements carried out by an independent authorized laboratory, as described in official permits. Based on these, there has not been any air pollution issue identified during the operating so far.

The basis of SK’s corporate mission is to support local communities, of which several examples can be mentioned during the short operation of the Komárom plant. In addition to the financial support provided to the city municipality to fight with the epidemic, HUF 15 million was also donated over 2 years to the city’s three public social, health and fire protection foundations.

Han Sang Kyu, Managing director of SK Battery Hungary, said that

“Our goal at Iváncsa is to grow together with the community by pursuing job security and long-term happiness for local people. I think that what we have learned so far in Komárom during the operation of the plant, including the understanding of Hungarian rules and regulations is a great asset and will contribute to achieving this goal.”
