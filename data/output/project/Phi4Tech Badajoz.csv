Spain begins to build its first battery factory for electric cars,,"Spain begins constructing its first lithium battery cell factory , and lithium extraction will commence in 2022. This step will minimize reliance on the Asian market and gradually lower the cost of automobiles equipped with lithium batteries.

The electric car presents not only the issue of autonomy and the obstacle of high-speed charging infrastructure but also the high cost of BEV automobiles. This is due to the high cost of lithium-ion batteries and significant investment in new technologies, beginning with the modular platforms on which these new cars are built.

Regarding lithium-ion batteries, which are used by electric cars and most hybrids and plug-in hybrids, even though Spain is a prominent participant in Europe's automotive sector, European manufacturers have an alarming reliance on Asia. This is where most of the lithium extraction industry and the majority of the market for the fabrication of cells for electric vehicle batteries are concentrated, even though some of the batteries are assembled locally.

In Spain, there are automobile plants for Renault, Mercedes-Benz, Nissan, Ford, the Volkswagen Group, and the PSA Group. Spain is a significant vehicle exporter to the whole European market, and our country is producing an increasing number of electric vehicles. However, our industry remains too reliant on Asia to supply battery cells utilized in these new electric cars.

Consider lithium extraction, and its usage in the construction of cells is already costly. In that case, the final price of batteries, and the ultimate price of this sort of automobile, are influenced by the additional transportation expenses. And now that we are in the midst of the so-called semiconductor crisis, it is more evident than ever that the principle of globalization is sound. Still, mismatches exist, and lowering reliance would be beneficial.

The situation as a whole demonstrates why Spain should produce batteries for electric vehicles. Not just for the sake of the whole European car market but also as an essential vehicle production hub for the entire Old Continent. Also, this might minimize reliance, lower costs, and assist the introduction of electric vehicles in Europe.

Many suggestions for lithium extraction in Spain have been made in recent years, but these projects have not materialized for various reasons. However, in 2018, the business Lithium Iberia began investigating the feasibility of harvesting lithium in Extremadura. According to their investigations, there is a vein of interest there, and they have been submitting papers to obtain an exploitation concession since then.

Lithium Iberia hopes to have this exploitation concession accessible during 2022, allowing operations to commence in Spain in 2023. This means that Spain will be operating a lithium mine to supply its battery plant for electric vehicles in less than two years.",https://www.evstories.com/phi4tech/spain-begins-build-its-first-battery-factory-electric-cars
Construction Begins for Spain’s First Major Production Base for Lithium Battery Cells,2021-08-04 22:00:00,"Various energy news websites have reported that construction started in June for Spain’s first GW-scale production base for lithium battery cells. The base is located in Noblejas, a municipality in the province of Toledo and within the autonomous region of Castilla-La Mancha. The main developer of this project is Phi4Tech, a company specializing in graphene-related technologies. The base is scheduled to begin pilot production before the end of this year.

This March, Phi4Tech and the regional government of Extremadura jointly announced the plan to establish an integrated industry cluster for lithium batteries. The Noblejas base has the advantage of being in close proximity to the Las Navas mine that contains lithium deposits. In Extremadura, mining company Lithium Iberia will build a refinery for lithium and a production plant for cathode materials. Additionally, there is a proposal to reopen the Aguablanca mine in Extremadura as this mine has deposits of nickel and cobalt. According to reporting by other media outlets, the Las Navas mine will be able to start supplying lithium to nearby battery production plants in 2023.

Capacity building at the Noblejas base will be implemented in multiple phases. Before the end of this year, the production capacity of the base is expected to reach 300MWh. Afterward, it will expand to 2GWh in 2023, 10GWh in 2025, and finally 20GWh in 2027. The construction of the Noblejas base and cathode production facility in Extremadura (i.e., in the province of Cáceres) will entail a total investment of around €1 billion. The development of the two projects is also expected to create 1,600 new jobs.

Phi4Tech and Lithium Iberia have also teamed up to build another GW-scale battery production base in Extremadura (i.e., in the province of Badajoz). This base will have a total production capacity of 10GWh and be developed in five phases, with 2GW being added each phase. Phi4Tech estimates that €400 million will be invested into the construction of the Badajoz base.",https://www.energytrend.com/news/20210804-22812.html

Many African industrial units, small and medium enterprises, still suffer from a lack of access to electricity, which is one of the major obstacles to economic and social development in Africa, the African Development Bank (AfDB) reported. According to the AfDB, the rate of access to electricity in Africa increased from 42% in 2015 to 54% in 2019, thanks largely to the financing of interconnection projects between African member countries and the increase in renewable energy projects, which account for 60% of the new 291 MW of electricity generation capacity installed in 2019. The bank mentioned the 580 MW Noor Ouarzazate, operational since late 2018, as a positive example.

Extremadura will host the first battery cell factory in southern Europe,2021-03-24 11:24:34+00:00,"The president of the Junta de Extremadura, Guillermo Fernández Vara, has pointed out that for the Autonomous Community “a new time is beginning” which means joining the industrial revolution of the 21st century and that “we really need it”.

Fernández Vara has assured that Extremadura aspires that its future does not depend every six years on how much money will come from European funds or on how it will be in the distribution of regional financing, but rather that it wants an “inclusive” project, a community that it receives from Spain and that it also contributes to the country’s economy.

For the Extremaduran president there is still a debt with the region “and that is that we can fly with our own wings” and be able to “also compete in the industrial league”, while he has assured that “a new actor arrives” who is tired of give an image that “has nothing to do with Extremadura today.”

He has repeated that he is a new actor who arrives with great enthusiasm and with the aim of being “masters of our destiny”, for which he has resources such as industrial land, sun and water, as well as electrical power to meet the needs that are arriving and of the railway improvements that will allow an exit to the merchandise from the region.

He also stated that in Extremadura “we are not in a permanent electoral campaign” but working for Extremadura, Spanish people, without fireworks, and wanted to express “loudly” that Extremadura does not renounce anything, while advancing that there will be more projects that will be presented when they become a reality.

The president described the project presented today as something “loaded with symbolism” and has had words to remember “many generations” of businessmen, politicians and citizens who have fought to make this possible, with a special mention for Juan Carlos Rodríguez Ibarra.

Fernández Vara has asked Spain “to let us fly” and has said that “we do not need wings, but that they do not cut them off, and that they treat us in the same conditions as others when making decisions.” On the other hand, he has received recognition from the Government and the Ministry of Industry, without whose participation the project presented today would “be impossible”.

He has also valued the role played by the University of Extremadura, which, he recalled, was born in 1974 and has not only allowed the children of day laborers to obtain degrees, but also a new generation of talented citizens who “capable of taking charge of our future”.

The Secretary General of Industry and SMEs, Raúl Blanco, has described this presentation as “excellent news for Extremadura and for our country”, especially at a time “so severe” in the health aspect.

He pointed out that the project began its journey about two years ago and that it is part of the strategy to accelerate the transformation of the automobile sector in Spain, while also underlining its importance as it is an initiative that will generate industrial activity and a quality and stable employment.",https://www.nanomate.es/en/news/extremadura-will-host-the-first-battery-cell-factory-in-southern-europe-with-an-investment-of-400-million-euros-and-500-jobs/
