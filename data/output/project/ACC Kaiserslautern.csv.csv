ACC granted funding to make batteries in Germany,2021-09-02 00:00:00,"ACC, the Franco-German initiative comprising PSA, Opel and Saft, has received funding notifications from the Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology (BMVi) and the state of Rhineland-Palatinate to start constructing a battery cell factory in Germany as part of the EU’s Battery IPCEI.

The federal and state governments are funding the project with a total of 436.8 million euros. They expect to see the joint venture Automotive Cell Company (ACC) start making batteries at the Opel plant in Kaiserslautern in two years.

Many steps have preceded the handover of the funding notification. ACC was founded at the end of 2018 in expectation of the European call for battery manufacturing, then still running under the catchphrase “Battery Airbus”. In December 2019, the EU Commission approved the first round of the official ‘Battery IPCEI’ as an “important project of common European interest.” At that time, a total of €3.2 billion in funding was earmarked for pan-European research and innovation projects from seven member states on all segments of the battery value chain.

In the case of ACC, the Franco-German consortium fired the starting gun to kick-off pilot production in January 2020 at a Saft facility in France. The partners will develop cell technology there before beginning production at scale at the actual battery plants in Douvrin and Kaiserslautern, each with a volume of 24 GWh per year.

The funding decision for 436.8 million has now been handed over to ACC, which PSA, its subsidiary Opel and TotalEnergies subsidiary Saft officially established in September 2020 for battery cell production. The sum already includes 51 million euros from the state of Rhineland-Palatinate, so the BMWi is taking over around 386 million euros. The companies involved in the joint venture are investing over two billion euros for this purpose.

At the handover ceremony, German Economics Minister Peter Altmaier spoke of a “very important milestone” and repeated the ambition for “the most innovative, sustainable and efficient batteries to come from Germany and Europe.” He added the new battery cell plant would secure around 2,000 jobs and, in future, produce battery cells for around 500,000 electric vehicles annually. “With batteries made in Germany, we secure the added value and jobs of tomorrow!” Altmaier said.

ACC CEO Yann Vincent sees an important step in the company’s still young history. “This vote of confidence from the German authorities reinforces our ambition to become a European leader in the development and manufacture of batteries for electric vehicles and to enable clean and affordable mobility for all,” Vincent said. “The agreement signed with the German government reflects this ambition.”

The first phase of construction will lead to 8 GWh output and is scheduled to start in 2023. Battery production in Kaiserslautern is expected to begin in 2025, according to Ralph Wangemann, Opel’s Managing Director of HR and Labour. Subsequently, two more blocks with eight GWh each are to be built to reach the targeted production of 24 GWh.

On Linkedin, however, ACC mentions a second “gigafactory”, the one in France, set to start producing battery cells in 2024, in line with a previous target. The company added that the second plant “should allow us to reach our production objective of 48GWh by the end of 2028.” We assume this is the total production.

Back in Germany, the BMWi announced all five approved projects from the first battery IPCEI have started. For the second battery IPCEI that saw Tesla competing as well, six of eleven projects are underway. These are also expected to receive funding notices “in the coming weeks,” the ministry said.

Inauguration of ACC's First Gigafactory: A European Mega-Project for Battery Production,,"On May 30, 2023, ACC (Automotive Cells Company) inaugurated its first gigafactory for electric vehicle batteries in Billy-Berclau/Douvrin in the Hauts-de-France region. ACC represents the culmination of the collaborative effort between TotalEnergies, Stellantis and Mercedes-Benz, and should accelerate Europe's transition towards a sustainable mobility accessible to all. Check out the infographic to find out more.

Founded in 2020, ACC is a joint venture between Stellantis, Mercedes-Benz and TotalEnergies, through its affiliate Saft, which is behind the technology used by ACC. ACC is positioned as a key player in the battery industry to equip high-performance, low-carbon electric vehicles that are accessible to the greatest number of people.",https://totalenergies.com/news/inauguration-accs-first-gigafactory-european-mega-project-battery-production
Germany: ACC Receives €437 Million To Build Battery Gigafactory,,"Automotive Cells Company (ACC), the battery joint venture between PSA Group (Stellantis) and Total, established in September 2020, will receive substantial funding in Germany.

In total, the company will get about €437 million ($519 million), including €386 million from the Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology (BMVi) and €52 million from the state of Rhineland-Palatinate, to build its first battery gigafactory in Kaiserslautern, in Rhineland-Palatinate state.

Construction of the plant is scheduled to start in 2023, while the production should begin in 2025. The plant is expected to have manufacturing capacity of 8 GWh annually, which will be expanded to 24 GWh annually later this decade.

Once completed, the plant is expected to supply enough battery cells for up to 500,000 electric cars annually.

Comparing the manufacturing output with the scale of incentives looks heavily subsidized, just to support the German Opel brand (part of Stellantis) and create up to 2,000 jobs.

The second Automotive Cells Company - a similar 8/24 GWh gigafactory - will be built in France, probably a year later.

In total, Automotive Cells Company intends to invest some €5 billion in the two plants, but €1.3 billion is expected to come from the European Union.

The lithium-ion technology will be provided by Total's subsidiary Saft, which currently is building a €200 million pilot plant at its Nersac facility.

In the broader picture, ACC will be only one of many battery suppliers for Stellantis, as the company already has contracts with CATL, BYD, SVOLT, Samsung SDI and LG Chem's LG Energy Solution.

We guess that depending on the competitiveness of the in-house battery production, Stellantis will decide whether to expand ACC or continue to rely on external suppliers.",https://insideevs.com/news/530878/germany-acc-437-million-gigafactory/
Funding Decision for Battery Cell Production at The Opel Site In Kaiserslautern Handed over: 437 Million Euros for Sustainable Battery Cell Production,2021-09-02 17:36:20+00:00,"Germany – Funding decision for battery cell production at the Opel site in Kaiserslautern handed over: 437 million euros for sustainable battery cell production.

Federal Minister of Economics Peter Altmaier,the Prime Minister of Rhineland-Palatinate, Malu Dreyer, and the Minister of Economic Affairs of Rhineland-Palatinate, Daniela Schmitt, handed over a grant notice for a large battery cell factory to be built there at the Opel site in Kaiserslautern.

The grant decision of the Federal Ministry of Economics has a total volume of 437 million euros (specifically 436.8 million euros) and is granted for the battery project “Automotive Cell Company – ACC” of the joint venture of the same name of the international automotive group Stellantis, Opel Automobile GmbH and the French battery manufacturer Saft. The state of Rhineland-Palatinate is initially contributing around 51 million euros, which is included in the total sum of 437 million euros.

Peter Altmaier, Federal Minister said:

We want the most innovative, sustainable and efficient batteries to come from Germany and Europe.

“The future ACCbattery cell production in Kaiserslautern is central to this. The new battery cell plant will secure employment for around 2,000 employees and sustainably produce battery cells for around half a million electric vehicles annually in the future. This is a milestone for the transformation of the German automotive industry towards sustainable drives: With batteries made in Germany, we are securing added value and jobs of tomorrow!”

Malu Dreyer, Prime Minister emphasized the importance of battery cell production for the Kaiserslautern site:

Battery cell production not only creates sustainable jobs and training places, it also underlines Kaiserslautern’s enormous innovation potential.

Here, a new phase of automotive engineering will be initiated and thus the great tradition of the Kaiserslautern location will be continued. “Battery cell production will also send a positive signal for the transformation,” said Prime Minister Malu Dreyer. The switch to electromobility is undoubtedly a challenge for the automotive industry, but one that can be mastered. The start of battery cell production in Kaiserslautern gives the employees of the industry a real future perspective.

“This innovative cutting-edge technology will put the Kaiserslautern site on an even broader foundation,” said Prime Minister Malu Dreyer with conviction.”

Daniela Schmitt, Rhineland-Palatinate Minister of Economic Affairs.

The entry into battery cell production upgrades Rhineland-Palatinate as an automotive location and helps it to achieve a leading position in the field of electromobility.

Yann Vincent, CEO ACC :

Today is an important step in acc’syoung history.

“We want to use this settlement in a targeted manner to locate other companies – especially SMEs – in this field of technology in the region and thus build up a competence network around battery-electric storage systems. The establishment of battery cell production will sustainably strengthen the economic development of the entire West Palatinate,”

“This vote of confidence from the German authorities reinforces our ambition to become a European leader in the development and manufacture of batteries for electric vehicles and to enable clean and affordable mobility for all. The agreement concluded with the Federal Government reflects this ambition.”

Ralph Wangemann, Managing Director Human Resources at Opel and Labor Director:

Today is a good day for Stellantis, Opel and the Kaiserslautern site.

“We are building a real giga-factory for battery cells here. From 2023, we will gradually build three blocks with a capacity of eight gigawatt hours each. Production is scheduled to start in 2025. In the future, our joint venture Automotive Cell Company will be able to equip 500,000 vehicles annually with state-of-the-art battery cells from the Kaiserslautern site alone and will thus make an important contribution to climate protection.”

“We want to produce the world’s best, most efficient and most environmentally friendly battery cells for long ranges in the Palatinate and thus make the location fit for the future in the age of electromobility.”

The project will create a battery cell factory in Kaiserslautern with an initial production capacity of 24 GWh and around 2,000 new jobs in production and development. The companies involved in the joint venture are investing more than 2 billion euros in this project. This creates a long-term perspective for the transformation towards electromobility for the plant in the Palatinate, which has so far been characterized by combustion engines and component production.

The ACC joint venture will also build an equally large battery cell factory in Douvrin in northern France, which will be funded by the French government as part of the same Important Project of Common European Interest (IPCEI).

Since the beginning of 2019, the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (BMWi), together with the European Commission and eleven other EU Member States, has been pursuing two major IPCEI projects for research and investment in the battery sector.

To promote the expansion of innovative battery cell production, the BMWi is providing a total of up to three billion euros. German companies play key roles in both IPCEI consortia. In total, investments of more than 13 billion euros are being initiated in the two IPCEIs in Germany alone by 15 supported companies.

It is expected that around 10,000 jobs will be created throughout Germany throughout Germany in the area of new environmentally friendly added value.

From the first battery IPCEI, all five projects approved by the EU Commission have now been launched, from the second IPCEI six out of eleven. The other German IPCEI projects will also be presented with the funding notices in the coming weeks.

The Kaiserslautern ACC battery cell plant is now legally and technically separate from the Opel site,2023-01-23 00:00:00,"

The Kaiserslautern ACC battery cell plant is now legally and technically separate from the Opel site



It has been clear for almost two years that one of Europe's largest factories for battery cells and modules to be installed in electric cars is being built in western Kaiserslautern. In the first few months of 2020, prominent politicians such as the then Federal Minister for Economic Affairs Peter Altmaier and the Prime Minister of Rhineland-Palatinate Malu Dreyer were in each other's hands - no wonder, since there is massive support from taxpayers' money in the billion-euro project. Declared goal: to make Europe independent of Asia in e-mobility.



The planning phase is now followed by implementation: As reports, the company's first German gigafactory has a good starting point for further work with the start of dismantling work on the former Opel factory buildings on December 22nd and the completion of the ""site separation"" achieved this year.



A new factory on the site of an old hall

The new factory will be built on the site of the Opel site, which currently produces components for Stellantis Group vehicles. ""A brownfield approach that is essential to ACC's sustainability strategy. The new production halls will be built on the site of old halls, so that no new space will be required, "" explains ACC Germany boss Peter Winternheimer. This contributes significantly to environmental protection.



All connections were cut and relocated

This technical separation of the Stellantis halls from the ACC halls was very complex and required special expertise. All previous connections  electric cables to every corner, water and waste water pipes, heating pipes, the entire media supply  to the former halls had to be cut, as most of the connections ran underground or at a dizzy height above the future construction site. At the same time, cables and pipes were laid, new connections made to ensure smooth, uninterrupted operations at the Stellantis site at all times.



In parallel with the completion of the technical preparations, the legal transfer of the future ACC site from Stellantis to ACC was also completed. The plant is therefore right on schedule, the first planning phase for the construction of the new factory in Kaiserslautern has been completed, according to the company.



The production of battery cells and modules is scheduled to start at the end of 2025, when the first block of the gigafactory has been built. After completion of the three production blocks at the end of 2030, the Kaiserslautern Gigafactory will reach its full capacity, produce cells and modules for up to 600,000 electric vehicles per year and employ around 2,000 people, reports ACC.



A European flagship project

ACC (Automotive Cells Company) was founded in 2020 as a joint venture for the development and production of battery cells and modules for electric vehicles by the Stellantis and TotalEnergies groups - together with their subsidiary Saft. In 2022, Mercedes-Benz joined as a third partner. ACC operates a research and development center in France near Bordeaux, as well as a state-of-the-art pilot and test facility in Nersac near Angoulême. A first production site, a so-called gigafactory, is currently being built in Billy-Berclau Douvrin, in northern France. In addition, the Applied Engineering Center is in preparation and the lithium-ion gigafactory in Kaiserslautern is scheduled to start work with the first production block in 2025. The third of the three planned gigafactories is expected to be built in the Italian city of Termoli.According to ACC, it will invest a total of around seven billion euros in the development and production of ""the latest battery technology for future mobility"" - a technology that is strongly supported by France, Germany and the European Union.



A good two billion euros are being invested in Kaiserslautern, of which the federal and state governments are contributing around a quarter  almost 450 million euros. When the factory starts in 2025, 700 people are to be employed in Kaiserslautern, and by 2030 it will eventually be 2,000  most of them skilled workers.
