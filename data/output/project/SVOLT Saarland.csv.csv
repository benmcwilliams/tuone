SVOLT confirms 2nd battery cell plant in Germany,2022-09-10,"SVOLT has confirmed building another cell factory for the European battery industry in Germany. The new site at Lauchhammer, Brandenburg, is a former wind turbine plant owned by Vestas. The company aims to repurpose it fast, by early 2025.

This is to make up for the delays SVOLT is now facing in Saarland. The Chinese company has been planning to produce battery cells in central Europe for some time and had confirmed factories in the German state of Saarland in November 2020. SVOLT aims to make cells near the town of Überherrn, close to a battery assembly in Heusweiler, also Saarland. However, the new plans in Brandenburg come on the back of said delays at the Saarland sites. We will come to these later.

Yet there are other reasons for Lauchhammer. Brandenburg, the state that surrounds Berlin, lies along the region’s supply chain and battery life cycle. There is, for example, the chemical company BASF which entered a partnership with SVOLT for battery materials and recycling at the end of 2021. BASF is currently building a cathode material factory, including a recycling pilot plant, in Schwarzheide, less than 7 kilometres from Lauchhammer.

SVOLT is planning to start production in Brandenburg in early 2025, Maxim Hantsch-Kramskoj, VP of Sales & Marketing of SVOLT Europe, told journalists. The company targets an initial capacity of 16 GWh.

That sounds like construction will quick (and rushed). The former Vestas site is a so-called brownfield project. SVOLT says it took over the plant, including buildings and infrastructure, from the previous owner at the end of August and will now “repurpose the majority of the existing halls”. However, rebuilding measures and extension works will also be necessary and realised in the near future, so SVOLT. The company adds that it was developing a master plan including a detailed schedule for all modernisation and building measures.

SVOLT sites in Saarland facing delays

At the same time, the construction of the Saarland sites will take much longer than planned. According to the Saarbrücker Zeitung paper, Kramskoy does not expect SVOLT to produce battery cells in Überherrn before 2027 – that is four years later than initially announced.

Even though Heusweiler builds on an existing building like Brandenburg, there would also be delays at this second Saarland site for the assembly of modules and packs, the manager said. Production was supposed to start in the middle of this year with parts from other SVOLT plants. Now the company says it will only begin assembly by February 2024.

Hantsch-Kramskoj did not detail the reasons for the delay but pointed to the project being “very complex”. Following experts, they would now reach master planning. The Saarland sites would get the time they require, he said.

SVOLT has to deliver, first from Brandenburg

Still, SVOLT has to deliver another driver for selecting the Lauchhammer site reasonably quickly. So far, PSA is confirmed as a customer and signed an option for 7 GWh as reported.

Kai-Uwe Wollenhaupt, President of SVOLT Europe & VP of SVOLT Energy Technology, said he was happy that they were able to conclude the conversations with Vestas timely and take over the site.

Mirko Buhr, Mayor of the City of Lauchhammer, also went on to “explicitly thank all those involved for their dedicated efforts to bring a successor company to the former Vestas site as swiftly as possible.”

The site offers 255,000 square metres of space, and SVOLT has the right of first refusal on an adjacent free area of another 71,000 sqm.

Hantsch-Kramskoj referred to the project as a “gigafactory” when speaking to the local press. Even if put in Tesla-speak, the new factory won’t compare to the Tesla plant in Grünheide, about 150 kilometres away.

As for synergies between the plants in Brandenburg and Saarland, SVOLT expects to utilise battery cells produced in Lauchhammer at the future assembly site in Heusweiler. At least until the Saarland cell factory comes online. SVOLT aims to produce between 22 and 32 Gwh, double the 16 GWh in Brandenburg. That is batteries for about 300,000 to 500,000 e-vehicles per year.

SVOLT has not disclosed which cells may be made in Brandenburg (and Saarland). However, the company has pushed cobalt-free battery cells since July 2019. These have undergone testing for at least two years now.

Plus, the battery maker that came out of Great Wall Motors reportedly produced a prototype batch of 20 Ah cells with a solid electrolyte based on sulphide only a few weeks ago in China. The prototype solid-state cells have an energy density of 350-400 Wh/kg. This is in line with SVOLT’s earlier tests, and the result promises a range of over 1,000 kilometres for electric cars in future.

SVOLT signs lease for battery factory in Germany,2022-12-12,"The Chinese battery manufacturer SVOLT has signed the lease for its future factory for the assembly of modules and packs at the Saarland site in Heusweiler. However, there is no mention of the future of the cell factory also planned in Saarland.

SVOLT itself says that the 15-year lease agreement underpins its long-term plans in Saarland. Parallel to the lease agreement, the company has also secured a possible right of first refusal.

The first part of the building (Production 1) is scheduled to go into use in April 2023, with the other parts of the building to follow in stages. The final completion is contractually agreed by mid-2024. SVOLT employees have already moved into the new administration building in Heusweiler.

In November 2020, SVOLT announced two projects in Saarland – on the one hand, the assembly of battery cells into modules and packs and, on the other hand, the headline-grabbing establishment of a 24 GWh cell factory in Überherrn. The statement at the time: in the former laminate park in Heusweiler – about 30 kilometres from Überherrn – operations were to start in mid-2022, in the cell factory at the end of 2023.

Cell production delayed in Germany

While according to the current announcement the delay for the assembly in Heusweiler will be less than one year, it is different for the cell factory: In September 2022 SVOLT had announced the construction of another battery factory in Brandenburg (planned production start is early 2025). In the course of this, it also became known that the construction of the cell factory in Saarland will be significantly delayed. Maxim Hantsch-Kramskoj, Vice President Sales & Marketing of SVOLT Europe, stated at the time that he did not expect cell production in Überherrn before 2027.

The assembly in Heusweiler will therefore not be carried out with locally manufactured cells, and a supply of battery cells from Lauchhammer in Brandenburg will also not be possible until 2025. Instead, cells from the Chinese SVOLT plants will probably be assembled into modules and packs there.

The plant in Heusweiler in the former ‘Laminate Park’ was converted by the Goldbeck company as a general contractor on behalf of the Batteriefabrik Heusweiler (PBH) project company. PBH is itself a spin-off of SHS-Strukturholding Saar. The aim is to continue to use the existing buildings on the site in the best possible way in terms of sustainability and to keep the conversion measures to a minimum. Thus, the centrally located building complex with a total area of around 23,000 square metres and the administration building will be retained. Some areas have been deconstructed to make room for new buildings with about 13,000 square metres as well as necessary logistics areas and outdoor facilities.

“With the signing of the lease agreement, we are underpinning our long-term plans in Saarland, which are a key element of SVOLT’s European expansion strategy,” says Kai-Uwe Wollenhaupt, President SVOLT Europe & Vice President SVOLT Energy Technology. “The plant in Heusweiler will be the first location in Europe to directly supply our customers with battery packs and modules. I would like to thank all the partners involved and am particularly pleased that the first employees have already been able to move into the office buildings in Eiweiler.”

Anke Rehlinger, Minister-President of the German state of Saarland, added: “Preserving existing jobs and creating new ones: That is the primary goal of the state government. The establishment of SVOLT will bring many new jobs and is a great opportunity for Saarland to play in the premier league of electromobility.”

SVOLT to build German battery factory in Saarland,2020-11-17,"The Chinese battery cell manufacturer SVOLT will build its European battery cell factory in the German state of Saarland. The cell factory itself is to be built in Überherrn, and an assembly of modules and packs in Heusweiler. Cell production is scheduled to start at the end of 2023.

Representatives of SVOLT Europe and the minister-president of the state of Saarland Tobias Hans made the announcement at a press conference. The Chinese company’s European cell factory is to be built on 840,000 square meters in Überherrn, with a capacity of 24 GWh per year in the final expansion stage. The cell factory is to start production at the end of 2023.

A second SVOLT site in Saarland is scheduled to start operations as early as mid-2022. In the former laminate park in Heusweiler, which is about 30 kilometres from Überherrn, modules and packs are to be assembled from battery cells and delivered to the car manufacturers ready for installation. In total, the Chinese company will invest up to two billion euros in the state for the two sites, and up to 2,000 jobs are to be created in the final expansion stage.

“We have selected Saarland as our first European production site for SVOLT’s high-end products for a number of reasons: It is not only at the heart of Europe but also represents a region of innovation and technology for the automotive industry,” said SVOLT Energy President Hongxin Yang in a video message. Yang could not attend the event in the state chancellery due to corona restrictions.

“The car is one of the central pillars of Saarland as an industrial location,” said Minister-President Hans. “We want to be at the forefront of the structural change in the automotive industry and develop our federal state into a cluster for innovation in Europe, especially in and for the automotive industry. For us, it is about playing a leading role in the development of environmentally-friendly vehicles of the future. We are pursuing a sustainable and innovative mobility concept. In this way, we can safeguard jobs as well as the attractiveness of Saarland as a place to live and work and at the same time ensure that we maintain our leading position as a car state.”

“Germany is a car country, Saarland is a car country,” said German Minister of Economics Peter Altmaier, who was born in Saarland, in a video message. “We want to remain that way in the future. That is why the Federal Government, the State Government, but also the EU Commission are pulling together to accompany the change”.

Saarland has thus prevailed among 32 candidates throughout Europe. “For SVOLT, Saarland is characterised by five factors”, says SVOLT European President Kai-Uwe Wollenhaupt. “These are the available and qualified employees, available green energy, the central location in the European economic area, an excellent infrastructure and the existing environment of international and innovative companies”.

Research centre in Saarland to follow

Wollenhaupt justified the decision for two sites instead of the original plan with one plant by citing a “significantly higher implementation speed”. In addition, the assembly in Heusweiler is an existing building that SVOLT is converting for its purposes. This work can be carried out in parallel with the construction of the actual cell factory.

According to earlier reports, SVOLT intends to build a cathode material plant and a research centre in Europe in addition to the actual cell factory. A research centre in Saarland is to follow later, Wollenhaupt said. But there was no longer any talk of a cathode material factory.

“As a high-tech company, SVOLT will focus on the development of subsystems such as battery cells, modules and control systems in Europe according to market conditions”, said Wollenhaupt. “For us, sustainable, responsible use of natural resources is at the heart of all associated activities. Among other things, we are working to establish a transparent supply chain and to continuously improve our production technologies and recycling processes.”

Discussions ongoing with several car manufacturers

Überherrn could also produce the cobalt-free battery cells that the company announced in July 2019. It was now announced that the test phase in the vehicles is about to be completed and the technology will be available to all customers next year.

Some of the cells from Saarland are expected to go to PSA. The French group reportedly signed a supply contract with SVOLT for seven GWh. According to recent French media reports, the cells could be installed in the Citroën e-C3. However, SVOLT is confident that the factory can quickly be filled with cells for other car manufacturers. The company is in active discussion with all European car manufacturers, it was said.

Specifically, gwSaar, the economic development agency of the Saarland, will buy the land, as gwSaar managing director Thomas Schuck stated. gwSaar will also construct the buildings on behalf of SVOLT. Later it will be decided whether the facilities will be sold to SVOLT or only rented out for the time being. Currently, there is still neither a sales contract for the site nor a building permit.

As Hans stated, the first contact with the company was made “very informally” at the beginning of the year, when they heard about the site search. A high level of confidentiality was maintained until the very end, with only a few employees from the State Chancellery and the Ministry of Economics being involved. Hans could also not help but make a small dig at Elon Musk when he pointed out that in other companies the location issue is publicly discussed on Twitter. The Saarland was also in the race for the European Gigafactory or had brought itself into the game. In the end, Brandenburg was awarded the contract, even though Lower Saxony was considered the public favourite.

FRANKFURT, Sept 9 (Reuters) - Chinese battery manufacturer SVOLT Energy Technology on Friday unveiled plans to build an additional cell assembly in Germany to supply electric vehicles, picking the state of Brandenburg - also home to Tesla's (TSLA.O) gigafactory - as a location.

The planned site in Lauchhammer would have a capacity of 16 gigawatt hours (GWh) per year and start production in 2025, a spokesperson representing the company said.

""The shift towards electromobility, but also government decisions, are driving demand for electric vehicles,"" SVOLT Chief Executive Hongxin Yang said. ""SVOLT is responding to this market dynamic with steady expansion by building additional local capacities.""

SVOLT in 2020 announced investments of up to 2 billion euros ($2.01 billion) to build a cell production facility as well as a module and pack factory in the south-western German state of Saarland with a planned production capacity of 24 GWh.

($1 = 0.9960 euros)

Svolt Energy to build 2nd plant in Germany for battery cell production,2022-09-13,"Svolt Energy previously had a plant in Germany for the production of battery packs.

Svolt Energy, the power battery maker that spun off from Great Wall Motor, will build a battery cell plant for the European market in Lauchhammer, Brandenburg, Germany, the company announced on its official WeChat account on September 9.

The plant will be Svolt Energy's first battery cell plant for overseas markets and its second overseas plant. It previously owned a battery pack plant in Heusweiler, Saarland, Germany.

The facility previously served as a wind turbine manufacturing facility for wind power giant Vestas, and Svolt Energy will upgrade it with plans already in the works, the power cell maker said.

Svolt Energy's investment will not only give the Vestas plant a new life, but will also contribute to the structural optimization of the electric vehicle industry in the Brandenburg region, said Brandenburg state premier Dietmar Woidke.

The area around Lauchhammer, and Brandenburg as a whole, has been forming a cluster for innovative electric vehicle development in recent years, which is an important reason why Svolt Energy is locating its second project abroad in the region, the company said.

Many companies in Svolt Energy's supply chain and battery lifecycle are located in the region -- such as globally known materials giant BASF, which entered into a partnership with it in late 2021 to work together on battery materials and their recycling, the company said.

Svolt Energy plans to produce the cells at its Lauchhammer-based facility and process them into packs at its plant in Heusweiler, according to the company.

Lauchhammer's location advantage helps Svolt Energy serve current customers' projects in a timely manner and meet its expansion capacity goals in Europe more quickly, it said.

Svolt Energy became independent from Great Wall Motor's power battery division in February 2018 to work on next-generation battery materials, cells, modules, pack, BMS, and energy storage technologies.

In August 2021, the company announced that its first cobalt-free battery rolled off the production line in mass production, and was the first such product in the world to come out of the lab and into mass production.

On July 19 of this year, Svolt Energy announced that its all-solid-state battery lab had developed China's first 20Ah-class sulfide all-solid-state prototype cells with an energy density of 350-400 Wh/kg.

Once the cells are mass-produced, they could enable electric vehicles to achieve a range of more than 1,000 kilometers, Svolt Energy said at the time.

Svolt Energy is one of China's largest power cell manufacturers, ranking sixth in August with a 2.49 percent market share in the country, according to data released earlier this month by the China Automotive Battery Innovation Alliance.

Svolt Energy is also one of the world's largest power battery makers, with a 1.3 percent share in January-July, ranking 10th, according to Seoul-based SNE Research.",https://cnevpost.com/2022/09/13/svolt-2nd-plant-germany-cell/
Svolt Energy begins construction of new $1.57 billion battery plant,2022-01-07,"The plant has a planned annual capacity of 22.3 GWh and is expected to be fully operational by the first half of 2023.

Chinese power battery suppliers are aggressively expanding production capacity at a time when the electric vehicle industry is growing rapidly.

Great Wall Motor-backed Svolt Energy announced Thursday that it has officially started construction of its power battery site in Yancheng, eastern China's Jiangsu province, with a planned annual capacity of 22.3 GWh.

Svolt Energy signed a contract with the local government two months ago for the project, which is planned to invest 10 billion yuan ($1.57 billion) and will use 873 acres (582,000 square meters) of land.

The company plans to build the plant in two phases and expects it to be fully operational by the first half of 2023, when it will become the core production base for the company's PHEV batteries and short-blade cells.

The project is an important part of the ""SV '600' Strategy"" and a key step in Svolt Energy's expansion into the Yangtze River Delta region, said Yang Hongxin, chairman and CEO of the company.

Svolt Energy announced its ""SV '600' Strategy"" on December 18, saying it aims to reach 600 GWh of battery capacity by 2025, nearly double its previous goal of 320 GWh.

Yang said at the time that total global demand for lithium batteries for electrification and energy storage in the transportation sector would exceed 1.8 TWh by 2025, and that the company aimed to capture 25 percent of the global market share.

Based on a 75 percent capacity utilization rate, Svolt is going to try to reach its goal of 600 GWh of global capacity, he said.

""In the face of the new cycle, Chinese companies must continue to stay ahead of the curve, with continuous innovation in technology and rapid ramp-up in capacity,"" he said.

Svolt Energy, a power battery company funded by Great Wall Motor in 2018, focuses on cobalt-free and solid-state battery research and development, and has established R&D centers in Japan, South Korea, the United States, India, Wuxi, Baoding and Shanghai.

The company currently has eight production sites with 297 GWh of capacity under construction, including 30 GWh of capacity being built in Europe.

In early August last year, Svolt Energy announced the completion of a Series B financing round totaling RMB 10.28 billion ($1.59 billion), led by Bank of China Group Investment Limited, with participation from Huaxing Growth Capital, a subsidiary of Chinese Renaissance.",https://cnevpost.com/2022/01/07/svolt-energy-begins-construction-of-new-1-57-billion-battery-plant/
SVOLT Energy Technology First to Scale Production of Safer Lithium-Ion Batteries with Soteria Battery Innovation Group,,"GREENVILLE, S.C., April 20, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- SVOLT Energy Technology Co., LTD. (SVOLT), a global advanced technology company and spin-off of Chinese automobile manufacturer Great Wall Motors, is first to begin commercialization of lithium-ion batteries (LIB) utilizing safety technology from Soteria Battery Innovation Group (BIG). With technology that eliminates the root cause of thermal runaway and dramatically improves battery safety, SVOLT's high-energy cells allow for more design freedom, providing confidence and reduced risk of recalls to their customers.
