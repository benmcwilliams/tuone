FREYR Battery Provides Operations Update,,"FREYR achieves important interim milestone by successfully conducting automated cathode casting trials

FREYR Battery (NYSE: FREY) (“FREYR” or the “Company”), a developer of clean, next-generation battery cell production capacity, has provided an update this morning on the company’s operational progress at the Customer Qualification Plant (“CQP”) in Mo i Rana, Norway.

Successful automated cathode casting trials

Following successful adjustments to the cathode casting equipment that included updates to the vacuum system, last week, FREYR’s teams at the CQP commenced automated cathode casting runs at a minimum nozzle distance of 0.26 mm.

The CQP teams have subsequently conducted successful cathode casting runs using the cathode web and solvent slurry at fixed nozzle distances of 0.5 mm and 1.0 mm, respectively, and at speeds of 2 meters per minute while using 100 psi of casting pressure. These successful automated cathode casting runs with solvent slurry were an important precursor to completing the Casting and Unit Cell Assembly commissioning packages and the eventual start of automated CQP production.

“I am very pleased to share that our teams at the CQP have reached another important interim technical milestone,” commented Mike Brose, FREYR’s Head of the Asset Mo team. “In doing so, our people and partners have demonstrated their collective ability to systematically link small but critical steps together to achieve the required outcome. We are able to integrate this vital part of the SemiSolidTM technology platform only because of the many milestones already completed together over the last several months by the FREYR Asset Mo team, our coworkers around the world, and our valued partners and suppliers. As we look forward to 2024, FREYR’s top priority is to finalize commissioning at the CQP and to begin automated production of in-spec, customer-testable batteries. With this latest milestone behind us, we will continue to apply unwavering focus to the remaining tasks that are necessary to achieve that goal.”

CQP commissioning status and key next steps

Following the successful automated cathode casting trials, FREYR has completed handovers of 342 (88%) of the 388 discrete production line equipment commissioning and testing packages at the CQP. The test center packages and handovers to operations are all complete.

The next technical requirements to stay on track with FREYR’s anticipated completion cadence at the CQP are:

Replicate the successful automated cathode casting trials with the anode production line system; and

Integrate the casting webs across the cathode, anode, and merge units of the Casting and Unit Cell Assembly equipment using the highly complex Multi-Carrier Systems (“MCS”) to reach automated cell production.

FREYR Battery Announces Plans for U.S. Gigafactory in Georgia,,"FREYR has selected and purchased a site in Coweta County, Georgia for multi-phase Giga America clean battery manufacturing project FREYR is announcing the development of the Giga America clean battery manufacturing facility based on the next-generation SemiSolid™ Lithium-Ion Battery Technology platform developed by 24M Technologies Inc (“24M”) in Boston, MA. The project is expected to be developed in multiple phases beginning with an initial battery cell production module of approximately 34 GWh at a preliminarily estimated capital investment of $1.7 billion. FREYR plans to undertake detailed plant engineering in the coming months, during which plans for the initial Gigafactory module will be finalized. The company and key stakeholders are evaluating additional value accretive upstream and downstream modules as well as a second cell production phase, which are expected to bring total capital investments to more than $2.6 billion by 2029. Over the life of the project, FREYR and its partners expect to create more than 720 U.S. jobs for highly skilled workers in Coweta County. FREYR has purchased the land for development of Giga America at the Bridgeport Industrial Park site in Coweta County, GA. The industrial zoned tract is 368 acres with options secured for further expansion. The site was selected for Giga America through a rigorous evaluation process based on key operational, logistical, and financial criteria. The Giga America site already offers substantial room for additional upstream and downstream development projects to further strengthen an anticipated strong cost position and improve the carbon footprint of the batteries produced. The development of Giga America pos itions FREYR to meet the rapidly growing customer demand for Energy Storage Systems (“ESS”) applications with U.S.-based conditional offtake partners. FREYR is seeing very strong interest for increased volume commitments through ongoing customer dialogues. FREYR is accelerating its previously planned U.S. expansion based on strong tailwinds in U.S. renewable energy development, an intensifying focus on grid stability initiatives, and the recently announced tax incentives associated with the Inflation Reduction Act. Projected U.S. demand is being augmented further by increased interest from existing and new customer dialogues in the commercial mobility and electric vehicle segments. FREYR is intensifying and broadening its financing efforts to support the expected capital commitments for the Giga America project in parallel with the ongoing construction of Giga Arctic in Mo i Rana, Norway; the evaluation of highly value accretive potential upstream and downstream modules in the Nordic region and the U.S.; and the continued development of FREYR’s organization. The State of Georgia and Coweta County are collectively providing strong financial incentives for the Giga America project. FREYR furthermore intends to apply with the U.S. Department of Energy for packages that could potentially include a grant and/or direct loan to assist with the development and possible acceleration of the project. FREYR is evaluating clean power supply solutions for Giga America with utility providers in the region, including the potential development of a dedicated solar plus storage facility. Giga America will leverage the 24M’s SemiSolid™ platform, which simplifies the production process of lithium-ion batteries significantly, enabling highly capital, labor, and energy efficient manufacturing at scale based on U.S. technology originating from MIT. FREYR’s project team in the U.S. intends to replicate the major elements of the Giga Arctic development, which will also be based on the 24M production platform, by maintaining a continuous technical dialogue with the company’s key personnel in Norway.

FREYR Battery (NYSE: FREY) (“FREYR”), a developer of clean, next-generation battery cell production capacity, has announced the selection and purchase of a site in Coweta County, Georgia for its planned Giga America battery plant. The company selected the Bridgeport Industrial Park site through a rigorous evaluation process based on key operational, logistical, and financial criteria, including the suitability of the site to co-locate modular upstream and downstream projects with the Giga America cell manufacturing facility.

FREYR is planning to initiate detailed project engineering of Giga America in the coming months. The initial phase of Giga America is planned to be a cell production module of approximately 34 GWh based on the next-generation of 24M’s U.S.-based SemiSolid™ production platform at an initial projected capital cost of $1.7 billion. The company is also evaluating value accretive upstream and downstream modules as well as additional cell production lines that are expected to bring total capital investments to more than $2.6 billion through 2029. Upon completion of all the contemplated construction phases, the Giga America complex is expected to be one of the largest battery cell manufacturing developments globally.

“Today’s landmark announcement underscores FREYR’s ambition to develop a very strong and near-term operational footprint in the United States. Expanding into the U.S. has been a foundational aspect of FREYR’s long-term strategy from our inception, and with the recent passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, we expect U.S. demand for ESS, passenger EV and other electric mobility applications to grow rapidly over the next decade,” commented FREYR’s Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer Tom Einar Jensen.

""Job creators and innovators from all over the world bring their operations to Georgia because they know they will have success here,"" said Governor Brian Kemp. ""We're proud to welcome FREYR to the Peach State as the latest company to bring transformational investments and opportunity to our communities. They will be a valued addition to our No. 1 state for business, and I look forward to their growing impact on Coweta and the surrounding region.""

FREYR Battery Reports First Quarter 2023 Results,,"FREYR Battery (NYSE: FREY) (“FREYR” or the “Company”), a developer of clean, next-generation battery cell production capacity, today reported financial results for the first quarter of 2023.

Highlights of the First Quarter 2023 and Subsequent Events:

In March, FREYR hosted customers, strategic partners, government officials, and other key stakeholders at the Chapter One opening event at the Company’s Customer Qualification Plant (“CQP”) in Mo i Rana, Norway. The event marked the completion of construction and the start of commissioning of the project that FREYR’s Board of Directors initially authorized in July 2021.

Following the opening event, FREYR’s project and operations teams have been performing comprehensive commissioning, integration, and production testing activities. With 296 of 388 distinct work packages integrating 35 production equipment packages from 16 discrete suppliers complete, FREYR now expects to begin casting electrodes with active cathode and anode materials in 2Q 2023. In the interim, FREYR’s teams are meticulously tuning in the production line equipment to prepare the operators for the interaction of the various production steps. Operating safely and securely while clearing punch items and conducting initial systems integration processes is a top priority as the active electrode and battery cell production milestones approach.

FREYR has received a letter from the Norwegian Government stating that it is updating and augmenting its response to the Inflation Reduction Act (“IRA”) and the EU’s Temporary Crisis Transition Framework (“TCTF”). According to the letter, the Norwegian Government is targeting solutions that enhance Norway’s comparative advantages and preconditions. The letter included a reiteration of Norway’s ambition to be an attractive host nation across the battery value chain and to attract large battery related investments in gigafactories through its national battery strategy in close collaboration with the European Union. The Government has also indicated that a detailed summary of its IRA response will be coming this summer.

With the tailwinds from recently announced support packages for gigafactories in Germany, France, and Spain and in anticipation of a response from the Norwegian Government, FREYR is proceeding with development of Giga Arctic at a measured pace to facilitate the optimization of project economics from a potential incentive package. Developing Giga Arctic and Giga America in parallel is intended to maximize option value for the Company, its customers, and other key stakeholders.

FREYR’s team has begun accelerated development of Giga America as a multi-phase manufacturing project to maximize the financial benefits of the IRA. The Company is now executing against a plan to develop Giga America in two phases consisting of an initial two production lines of 2.5 GWh of nameplate capacity with targeted Start of Production (“SOP”) in summer 2025, followed by an additional eight production lines yielding a combined total of 38 GWh of nameplate capacity subject to planned production line equipment upgrades and final product specifications.

FREYR’s financing activities are advancing through project level financing efforts with strategic and financial stakeholders. Discussions include the initial and subsequent phases of Giga America, which is supported by the IRA; and Giga Arctic, which is supported by the ongoing project financing process and the anticipated Norwegian IRA response. Both processes are linked to relevant progress on battery cell performance and operating parameters at the CQP.

In March, FREYR announced that the Company had entered into discussions to form a strategic coalition with Glencore Plc (LN: GLEN), Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE: CAT), Siemens AG (GY: SIE), and Nidec Corporation (TSE: 6594) to pursue the scale up of sustainable battery solutions across Europe, North America, and beyond. Representatives from each of the four partners subsequently participated in a panel with FREYR at the Chapter One CQP opening event to discuss the aspirations of the coalition.

In April, Siemens and FREYR announced that the two companies have established a strategic partnership in alignment with the proposed coalition to achieve giga scale battery production using Siemens’ Xcelerator open digital business platform and the immersive industrial metaverse co-created with Nvidia (NYSE: NVDA) and AWS. Additionally, Siemens and FREYR indicated that they are exploring potential project level financing solutions. The partnership with Siemens is intended to significantly enhance FREYR’s own ongoing developments in leveraging AI and digitally enhanced simulation systems to improve future battery cell performance and reduce testing and production lead-times.

With the anticipated start of active electrode casting at the CQP approaching and several other strategic and financial initiatives gaining momentum, FREYR is proud to invite its investors, analysts, and partners to the Company’s Chapter Two event, FREYR’s inaugural Capital Markets Day, on June 27th at the New York Stock Exchange. The Chapter Two event will be streamed live and will feature remote video demonstrations of the CQP’s functionality and electrode production on the SemiSolidTM platform from Mo i Rana, Norway.

“The first quarter was punctuated by the start of FREYR’s operational journey on the path to becoming a global producer of clean, next-generation battery cells,” remarked Tom Einar Jensen, FREYR’s Co-Founder and CEO. “With the grand opening of the CQP behind us following the delivery of a remote, industrial scale manufacturing project in under two years, our project, operations, and technology teams have continued to work diligently to conduct the complex and detailed commissioning, integration, and testing activities that will enable us to reach initial battery production and additional milestones in 2023. As a result of their continued dedication and progress, I am very pleased to report that we expect to begin producing electrodes with active cathode and anode materials at the CQP in the current quarter, which is a key milestone as we advance towards fully automated cell production. With the tailwinds from the IRA prompting significant and timely government support for gigafactories in Germany, France, and Spain, FREYR is increasingly well positioned on both sides of the Atlantic as we continue the development of Giga Arctic and Giga America in parallel.”

“We are very happy to announce our phased project development for Giga America with an initial targeted SOP in summer 2025 in Coweta County, Georgia,” commented Jeremy Bezdek, President of FREYR Battery US and EVP of Global Corporate Development. “We currently project that this two-phase, ten production line project could generate up to $8 billion in value to FREYR, and we have initiated a capital raising process focused on project level equity. We believe it’s very attractive for our strategic partners to own plant level equity, and we expect that our shareholders will be pleased that we are pursuing a funding solution for the project that minimizes dilution.”

“As we enter the next phase of FREYR’s evolution, we intend to communicate frequently about the relevant technical milestones associated with scaling up clean battery production from the SemiSolidTM platform, and we will regularly update the market on the achievement of such milestones,” commented Jan Arve Haugan, FREYR’s Chief Operating Officer. “With the help of 24M and our other industrial partners, we are now positioned to begin producing electrodes in the second quarter, with the ramp towards fully automated production to follow.”

Business Update

FREYR’s operations team is ramping up activities at the CQP ahead of the anticipated first electrode production in 2Q 2023. In the weeks subsequent to the Chapter One opening event, FREYR has completed 296 of 388 distinct work streams integrating 35 production equipment packages from 16 discrete suppliers.

Construction of Giga Arctic continues to proceed at a measured pace in anticipation of a potential Norwegian response to the IRA. FREYR spent $64.1 million on previously authorized capital expenditures in 1Q 2023, approximately 75% of which were allocated to Giga Arctic, with the remainder primarily going towards the completion of the CQP.

The project financing process for Giga Arctic has continued in line with the pace of physical progress on the plant in anticipation of a potential Norwegian response to the IRA. FREYR continues to work with its banks, ECAs, and their consultants, and the opening of the CQP marks a major progress point. Other milestones key to the project financing include the CQP producing testable batteries, acceptance of those batteries by customers, and operational milestones that can be extrapolated to the performance of Giga Arctic from an engineering perspective.

FREYR is executing the Company’s plan to fast-track development of Giga America. With an accelerated development timeline and detailed project plan now in place, U.S. leadership is actively engaging with potential strategic and financial partners to raise project-level equity for Giga America. If the Company’s capital formation endeavors proceed according to plan, FREYR is targeting a final investment decision on the initial phase of Giga America before year-end 2023.

In conjunction with the start of Giga America project development, FREYR has launched a capital formation process. For the initial phase, FREYR is working with a financial advisor and is pursuing project level investment from strategic and financial partners to fund the accelerated two-line plan with a targeted SOP in 2025. The Company plans to fund the subsequent phase through a combination of traditional project financing and other instruments.

Now that the Giga America development plan has been defined, FREYR has accelerated its discussions with the U.S. Department of Energy Loan Production Office, particularly with respect to the eight-line phase of the project. FREYR is also carefully monitoring grant opportunities at the U.S. federal, state, and local levels and received $20 million in cash from Coweta County in 1Q 2023, as well as approval to receive another $7 million from the State of Georgia later this year. These grants are part of the previously announced multiple phase state and local incentive package of approximately $410 million.

The work on operationalizing the strategic coalition to accelerate the energy transition is progressing. The proposed coalition members have identified core focus areas that will require substantial scale up of sustainable battery solutions. Such focus areas currently include the decarbonization of heavy industry and mining, providing energy as a service product, enabling sustainable supply chains, ensuring recycling and circular solutions as well as the decarbonization of other sectors. Since the launch of this initiative, FREYR has been approached by a broad range of other multinational companies from various sectors expressing interest in joining the coalition.

FREYR continues to make significant progress developing its global supply chain by evaluating, pursuing, advancing, and signing raw materials agreements with its growing network of partners. In accordance with the Company’s plan to develop Giga Arctic and Giga America in parallel while localizing supply chains, FREYR is expanding existing relationships with suppliers to include U.S. plant development and pursuing backup and alternative sources of key material inputs.

Overview of Financial Results

FREYR reported a net loss attributable to ordinary shareholders for the first quarter of 2023 of $(12.7) million, or $(0.09) per diluted share compared to a net loss for the first quarter 2022 of $(34.9) million or $(0.30) per diluted share. The net loss in the first quarter of 2023 was due to corporate overhead, spending to support FREYR's projects and business development activities, and research and development spending, partially offset by gains on foreign currency transactions.

As of March 31, 2023, FREYR had cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash of $474.8 million.

Business Outlook

FREYR is focused on advancing the following strategic mandates and milestones:

Produce the first battery from the CQP, integrate production line equipment modules to reach fully automated production of cells and modules, and ramp production of testable batteries.

FREYR Battery Provides Operations Update,,"FREYR achieves important interim milestone by successfully conducting automated cathode casting trials

NEW YORK & OSLO, Norway & LUXEMBOURG, November 29, 2023--(BUSINESS WIRE)--FREYR Battery (NYSE: FREY) (""FREYR"" or the ""Company""), a developer of clean, next-generation battery cell production capacity, has provided an update this morning on the company’s operational progress at the Customer Qualification Plant (""CQP"") in Mo i Rana, Norway.

Successful automated cathode casting trials

Following successful adjustments to the cathode casting equipment that included updates to the vacuum system, last week, FREYR’s teams at the CQP commenced automated cathode casting runs at a minimum nozzle distance of 0.26 mm.

The CQP teams have subsequently conducted successful cathode casting runs using the cathode web and solvent slurry at fixed nozzle distances of 0.5 mm and 1.0 mm, respectively, and at speeds of 2 meters per minute while using 100 psi of casting pressure. These successful automated cathode casting runs with solvent slurry were an important precursor to completing the Casting and Unit Cell Assembly commissioning packages and the eventual start of automated CQP production.

""I am very pleased to share that our teams at the CQP have reached another important interim technical milestone,"" commented Mike Brose, FREYR’s Head of the Asset Mo team. ""In doing so, our people and partners have demonstrated their collective ability to systematically link small but critical steps together to achieve the required outcome. We are able to integrate this vital part of the SemiSolidTM technology platform only because of the many milestones already completed together over the last several months by the FREYR Asset Mo team, our coworkers around the world, and our valued partners and suppliers. As we look forward to 2024, FREYR’s top priority is to finalize commissioning at the CQP and to begin automated production of in-spec, customer-testable batteries. With this latest milestone behind us, we will continue to apply unwavering focus to the remaining tasks that are necessary to achieve that goal.""

Story continues

CQP commissioning status and key next steps

Following the successful automated cathode casting trials, FREYR has completed handovers of 342 (88%) of the 388 discrete production line equipment commissioning and testing packages at the CQP. The test center packages and handovers to operations are all complete.

The next technical requirements to stay on track with FREYR’s anticipated completion cadence at the CQP are:

Replicate the successful automated cathode casting trials with the anode production line system; and

Integrate the casting webs across the cathode, anode, and merge units of the Casting and Unit Cell Assembly equipment using the highly complex Multi-Carrier Systems (""MCS"") to reach automated cell production.
