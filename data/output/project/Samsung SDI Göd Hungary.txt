Article 1: {'title': 'Samsung SDI expands battery production in Hungary', 'published_date': '2021-02-24 00:00:00', 'keywords': [], 'text': 'The Korean battery cell manufacturer Samsung SDI has announced that it will invest the equivalent of around 740 million euros in the expansion of its battery factory in Göd, Hungary, near Budapest.\n\nThe factory, from which Samsung SDI supplies cells for BMW and Volkswagen, among others, currently has an annual capacity of 30 GWh and is expected to be able to produce over 40 GWh in the future. Samsung SDI had completed the construction of the factory in 2017. It is not clear from the South Korean media reports when the expansion is to be completed.\n\nWith the investment of around one trillion won, which is equivalent to a little more than 900 million US dollars or the aforementioned 740 million euros, the Korean company apparently hopes to expand its position in the electric car market in Europe. The investment is to be partly financed by a capital increase of the Hungarian subsidiary Samsung SDI Hungary Zrt, but also by loans.\n\nIn South Korea, an unnamed representative of Samsung SDI told the Reuters news agency that the manufacturer was also considering building a second plant in Hungary. However, a decision or even a timetable for the construction of such a factory had not yet been made. In addition to Hungary, Samsung SDI has plants in South Korea and China. Worldwide, Samsung SDI ranks fifth among battery cell manufacturers.\n\npulsenews.co.kr, koreaherald.com, reuters.com'}...
Article 2: {'title': 'Samsung SDI plans to produce cylindrical battery cells in Hungary', 'published_date': '2023-01-12 00:00:00', 'keywords': [], 'text': 'Samsung SDI is considering building a new battery cell factory in Hungary, according to Korean media. The plant is to supply BMW exclusively with round cells for the New Class electric cars and is to be built near Samsung SDI’s existing two battery factories in Göd.\n\nBMW is currently building an electric car plant in Debrecen, Hungary, where series production for the first all-electric New Class vehicle will start in 2025, flanked by a battery assembly line. CATL and Eve Energy, as well as Envision AESC, have so far been confirmed as suppliers of the round cells for the New Class vehicles that will roll off the production lines in Europe, China and the USA. Samsung SDI already supplies battery cells to BMW, but has not yet been officially confirmed as a supplier for the new round cells. However, Samsung SDI is indeed developing such cells.\n\nAccording to Business Korea, Samsung SDI in Hungary is considering setting up a joint venture for batteries with BMW. However, it would come as a surprise if the trio of suppliers actually became a quartet. In September, the Munich-based carmaker had officially announced that it would have the round cells for the New Class explicitly produced by three partners in a total of six factories. Through the partnerships, BMW wants to buy the battery cells where the production takes place (“local for local”).\n\nIn the USA, Envision AESC in South Carolina is to pull the strings. Eve Energy is currently expanding its production capacities in China, for example in Chengdu, Yuxi and Jingmen, so that a China focus is emerging with Eve. In August 2022, CATL announced the construction of a 100 GWh battery cell factory in Debrecen, Hungary, for European car manufacturers, and it stands to reason that, in addition to the confirmed major customer Mercedes-Benz, BMW will also be supplied from the factory. Eve Energy has also been linked to Debrecen – according to reports from the end of March 2022, Eve Energy signed a non-binding letter of intent with the local municipality to acquire 45 hectares in an industrial area in order to build a plant for the production of cylindrical cells there. Since then, however, nothing more has been heard of it.\n\nIn recent months there have been growing indications that BMW might change its battery strategy and switch to round cells. In November, the manufacturer clarified the situation: As previously leaked, the new round cells for the New Class will have a uniform diameter of 46 millimetres and different heights (format: 46XX). There will be two different heights (although BMW does not give any concrete millimetre specifications) and the module level will be omitted during installation. The round cells are “flexibly integrated into the installation space in a space-saving manner”. The storage system will play a supporting role in the body structure. In technical jargon, this battery concept is called “pack-to-open-body”. Samsung SDI is already developing such battery cells.\n\nIn the current generation of electric vehicles, the Munich company still relies on prismatic cells from suppliers such as CATL and Samsung SDI – for example in the i4, iX and i7. According to the manufacturer, the new round cells will “increase the energy density by more than 20 per cent, increase the charging speed by up to 30 per cent and improve the range by up to 30 per cent”.\n\nbusinesskorea.co.kr, english.chosun.com'}...
Article 3: {'title': 'Samsung SDI to construct new battery factory for BMW in Hungary', 'published_date': '2023-01-17 06:10:53+00:00', 'keywords': [], 'text': "Samsung SDI is planning to construct a new battery manufacturing plant in Göd, Hungary reports The Elec. According to the publication, Samsung will produce batteries mainly for BMW’s electric cars at the new battery manufacturing plant. Reportedly, these batteries will be made according to the specifications provided by the German car manufacturer.\n\nThe new factory will be called Plant 3, and it will be constructed near Samsung’s existing battery manufacturing units—Plant 1 and Plant 2—in the region. The existing factories were converted from CRT and PDP manufacturing facilities to battery manufacturing plants in 2016. According to The Elec, Samsung has already completed the purchase of the land for the factory, and it will invest KRW 1 trillion (around $807 million) into it. The upcoming facility is said to produce 12 million cells per month across 15 to 20 production lines.\n\nSamsung SDI partnered with BMW in 2009 to supply the German car manufacturer with lithium-ion batteries for the company's i-series electric cars. Recently, the Executive Chairman of Samsung Electronics, Lee Jae-Yong, met with the CEO of BMW, Oliver Zipse, to discuss the partnership between the two companies. It looks like the decision by Samsung SDI to construct a new battery manufacturing plant for BMW in Hungary is a direct result of that meeting.\n\nSamsung is expected to produce a new prismatic battery at the upcoming factory. Compared to Samsung SDI’s 5th generation Zen battery, the new prismatic battery will be shorter and wider. This will help BMW lower the center of gravity in its electric cars. A lower center of gravity enhances the stability of a vehicle, and thus, improves its handling characteristics. The report also suggests that this battery will use new types of materials.\n\nSamsung SDI has recently been making rapid progress in batteries for electric vehicles (EVs). Last year, the company showcased the latest battery technologies for commercial vehicles at the IAA Transportation exhibition, which also included the company’s roadmap for solid-state batteries. Since the EVs are on the rise, Samsung SDI has been selling more and more EV batteries recently. As a result, Samsung SDI posted record-high profits in Q3 2022."}...

Kim Woochan, the managing director of Samsung SDI, said the new plant might become one of the largest in the world.\n\nPéter SzijjártÃ³, Hungary’s foreign minister, commented: "With this new investment, it is now clear that Hungary will become one of the strongholds of European car manufacturing in the new automotive era."\n\nHe added that the plant would ensure that the Hungarian economy would expand by 2% more than the EU average.\n\nTwo other South Korean EV battery-makers, Inzi Controls and SK Innovation, have also invested in Hungary.\n\nThe government of Hungary is planning to offer a grant for an undisclosed amount to Samsung for the project, which will create 1,200 jobs, but this has yet to be approved by the European Commission.\n\nSamsung SDI has two factories in Asia and one in Europe, in Göd. The company’s plan, if it goes ahead, will be the third largest foreign investment in the Hungarian economy since 2016.\n\nImage: Samsung’s Göd plant north of Budapest (Bjoertvedt/CC BY-SA 3.0)\n\nFurther reading:'}...
