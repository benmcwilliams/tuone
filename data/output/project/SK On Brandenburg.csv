Newcomer EV Battery Manufacturer SK On Plans To Lead Global Market,2022-09-08,"This story appears in the September 2022 issue of Forbes Asia. Subscribe to Forbes Asia

A former division of billionaire Chey Tae-won’s SK conglomerate, Seoul-based electric vehicle battery manufacturer SK On has huge ambitions. Its co-CEO Jee Dong-seob explains how it will become the world’s largest supplier of EV batteries by 2030.

S K On co-CEO Jee Dong-seob has a simple but bold goal for his company: to become the world’s largest electric vehicle battery maker by output by 2030.

“We will definitely be on par with the number one, or be the world’s leading battery maker,” Jee says, 59, in an exclusive interview from Seoul. It’s his first-ever interview since taking charge. “We believe that we will be able to smoothly, without any major challenges, achieve our goal.”

SK On is currently the fifth-largest supplier of EV batteries in the world at a capacity of 13.2 gigawatt hours (or gwh, the standard measure for EV battery output), according to an August report by Seoul-based SNE Research. The company’s annual battery sales hit $2.3 billion in 2021, up from $1.2 billion a year earlier and $530 million in 2019, when the company ranked as the ninth-largest battery maker. “What really stands out is that we are the world’s fastest-growing battery maker,” says Jee.

It’s a strong track record for a company that didn’t exist three years ago. SK On was spun off as its own company last October from SK Innovation, a holding company for both traditional and alternative energy businesses under SK group, one of Korea’s largest chaebols. There’s still a long way to go. “Of course, our competitors are also working very hard,” Jee says.

Currently the world’s largest EV battery maker is China’s Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL), which holds about 35% of the total global market. Headed by billionaire Robin Zeng, whose net worth exceeds $45 billion, CATL supplies batteries to BMW, Tesla and other major automakers. The Chinese battery giant is followed by SK’s crosstown rival LG with about 14%, China’s BYD at 12% and Japan’s Panasonic with 10%. SK On has about a 6.5% share, according to SNE data. Last year, SK On overtook its other big rival Samsung, which was formerly in the fifth spot but has been steadily losing its foothold.

The competitive landscape for these top producers may transform within the decade. SK On estimates that by 2030, the global EV market will reach 2.5 terawatt hours, worth at least $263 billion, or 31.3 million EVs, if each vehicle is equipped with a standard 80 kilowatt-hour battery. To meet its targets, SK On plans a major international expansion that hinges on “nurturing and managing” a global network of partnerships and factories, particularly in Europe, the world’s second-largest EV market. In March, U.S. automaker Ford and SK On formed a joint venture for an EV battery factory in Turkey. From 2025, the new facility will have an annual production capacity of between 30gwh and 45gwh a year. That’s only the beginning, says Jee.

T he Korean battery maker now has seven factories across Europe, China and the U.S. Its first plants outside Korea opened in 2020 in China, situated in Changzhou and Huizhou. SK On has two more plants slated to start operating in 2024, including one in Iváncsa, Hungary, and another in Yancheng, China. Some $3.5 billion has been earmarked for two more plants in China due to open by 2025.

Investing abroad may be money well spent. Overseas factories located close to major EV markets help battery makers cut the costs of conveying their products to EV assembly lines, says Sam Abuelsamid, principal analyst for e-mobility with Guidehouse Insights in the U.S. “Batteries are large, heavy and potentially dangerous to transport,” he says. “Localizing production to where the vehicles are going to be produced and sold can dramatically reduce logistics costs.” Most major Western automakers are investing directly into cell production, he added, including Ford and Volkswagen. SK On supplies both.

A year ago, Ford announced plans for two new megaprojects, BlueOval City and BlueOval SK, the latter a joint venture with SK. BlueOval City is spelled as Blue Oval City in the photo. Jon Cherry/Bloomberg

SK On is scoping out the American market, where it already has a factory in the aptly named city of Commerce in Georgia. The U.S. is now the world’s third-largest EV market, accounting for 4.5% of global sales, behind Europe at 16% and China at 14%, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). In July, SK On officially started BlueOval SK, a joint venture with Ford Motor, which is the companion megaproject to Ford’s BlueOval City that will produce EVs. The partners plan to invest a total of $8.9 billion for mass-producing batteries at three new plants in Kentucky and Tennessee. Operations will start in 2025 at a total production capacity of over five times SK On’s existing facilities in Georgia. A Ford website dubs the BlueOval project as “the largest ever manufacturing investment at one time by any automotive manufacturer in the U.S.”

In a recent statement, BlueOval SK CEO David Hahm said: “With the strong partnership between these two companies, we will secure unparalleled competitiveness in the global EV market.” SK On’s ties to Ford go back to 2018, when SK Innovation was tapped to produce nickel-rich batteries for the Ford Lightning electric pickup truck.

Y et SK On, like its peers, faces a volatile global market for rare earth metals—primarily cobalt, lithium, and nickel—that are the key components for batteries. The rapid increase in EV sales during the pandemic has strained the resilience of battery supply chains, according to a May report from the IEA, as demand for EVs threatened to outstrip the supply of raw materials.

Rare earth prices surged due largely to Russia’s invasion and ongoing conflict in Ukraine. Russia supplies 20% of global high-purity nickel, while Ukraine supplies 30% of the world’s lithium. By May, lithium prices were more than seven times higher than at the start of 2021, leading the IEA to forecast that batteries could be 15% more expensive in 2022. Nonetheless, oil prices have gone up as well, thus mitigating the comparative shock of higher EV prices. Governments around the world are subsidizing the cost of electric vehicle purchases for environmental benefits, thus driving EV battery demand.

The CEO says SK On has racked up an enviable order backlog, a crucial indicator to support growth. The group’s confirmed EV battery backlog stands at 1,600gwh, equivalent to the installed capacity of approximately 20 million EVs, or approximately $176 billion in value per SK On’s estimates. But others have sizable backlogs as well, such as LG Energy Solution, which has an order backlog worth $231 billion, an LG spokesperson said in a March earnings call.

Jee says what will propel SK On to the top spot is the company’s proprietary technology, the fruit of the SK group’s decade of battery research. SK On has said it will spend at least $1 billion over the next two years on research and development, with a particular focus on the company’s uniquely nickel-rich EV batteries. Their composition gives them a higher charging density than lithium-based batteries, making them more efficient and improving their range. “SK On was able to grow rapidly and secure an order backlog because the market recognized [our] battery technological capabilities and quality,” Jee says. In 2012, SK had a world-first in making EV batteries that were over 60% nickel.

Nickel has another advantage as there are none of the supply constraints currently hitting lithium and cobalt production. Nickel production was spurred well before the rise of EVs by its use in stainless steel, whose makers are still the largest buyers of nickel worldwide. SK On since January has been mass-producing a unique type of EV battery composed of 90% nickel, and those batteries power Ford’s new F-150 Lightning pickup truck—the electric version of its most popular vehicle, which was launched this year.

Jee is particularly proud of the fire safety of the company’s EV batteries, for which he says it has an unrivaled safety record. Of about 350 million battery cells manufactured, SK On says none have caught fire. The CEO credits this safety record to a unique separator technology, dubbed “z-folding,” that zigzags through the battery’s charging terminals to minimize fire risks. “I can tell you that you will never see a fire break out in our batteries,” Jee says.

Still, fires are extremely rare. The battery safety group EVFireSafe, which is backed by the Australian government, verified only 246 EV battery-related fires globally since 2010 in over 16 million EVs in active use.

SK On’s current portfolio includes nickel-rich batteries, lithium-ion batteries and LFP cells, a battery type that relies on a compound of lithium, iron and the chemical phosphorus. The batteries typically installed in cheaper vehicles have an energy density of around 60%, which means they require frequent charging. To overcome the challenge of battery endurance, the company is developing batteries that are solid rather than liquid-based, and batteries that are more compact than traditional EV batteries. Prismatic batteries offer stability for longer trips, while pouch batteries are more portable and can be used in smaller EVs.

SK On is currently the fifth-largest supplier of EV batteries in the world.

Over the past year, the pace of SK On’s growth helped expand the entire SK conglomerate. In May, Korea’s Fair Trade Commission said investment in “sustainable energy companies” helped SK become the second-largest corporate group in South Korea by asset size after Samsung, overtaking Hyundai Motors—the first change in rank among the country’s top five business empires in 12 years. SK On’s rise also underscores SK’s pivot into green energy—a radical transformation for an empire generating over half its business from oil and petrochemicals. The company is also important to billionaire Chey Tae-won. He chairs SK, which his family started and still controls. That significance is flagged by the fact that Chey’s younger brother, Chey Jae-won, is the co-CEO of SK On. The younger Chey was unavailable to comment.

Jee’s career has long been with SK. Born in Icheon, he received a bachelor’s degree in physics in 1987 and a master’s degree in economics in 1990 from Seoul National University. Upon graduation, he began working in the business planning department of Yukong, formerly known as Korea Petroleum, the country’s first oil refinery. Through a series of mergers, Yukong became part of the SK group. Jee progressed in management through SK’s divisions for telecoms, oil and energy, and battery making.

To fuel growth, SK On is looking to list by 2025 at the earliest. In March, local media reported that SK was in talks with private equity firms, including Carlyle Group and BlackRock, to raise $3.1 billion in pre-IPO fuhnding. Two months later, SK On announced it had secured $2 billion in bank loans to expand business in Europe, which it said would improve its IPO prospects. A listing would be the latest among SK On’s peers, as LG Energy Solution held Korea’s largest public offering in January, raising $10.7 billion. SK Group’s battery-separator unit SK IE Technology fetched $2 billion for its listing in May.

Jee says SK On is already planning ahead, developing batteries for specific vehicle types. “There will be commercial vehicles—pickup trucks, for instance—that will be running on EV batteries for entry-model or the more low-cost EVs,” Jee says. The market will also evolve as the charging infrastructure becomes more widespread and accessible. Jee wants to position SK On to be able to grab emerging opportunities. It’s still “early stages for the EV market,” he says.

US: SK Innovation Announces Five Battery Plants And 150 GWh/Year,,"SK Innovation has become Ford's strategic battery supplier in the U.S. and a key partner in the recently announced massive $11.4 billion invetments in Tennessee and Kentucky.

With SK Innovation's two battery plants in Commerce, Georgia (the first will start production in early 2022, while the second one in 2023), and three additional plants (to be built in Tennessee and Kentucky), the South Korean manufacturer will have a total production capacity of over 150 GWh of battery cells per year around 2025.

If no one will come forward with bigger investments (we guess that there will be some, including Tesla, LG Chem's LG Energy Solution or Panasonic to name just a few), SK Innovation would ""become the largest battery maker in the U.S.""

The twin battery plants in Kentucky (2x 43 GWh/year) might be also the largest battery production plant ever in the country.

SK Innovation invests billions in the expansion into the U.S. market with $4.45 billion in the BlueOvalSK joint venture with Ford (50/50) and $2.6 billion in its own plants in Georgia.

According to the press release, the company will invest up to $6.4 billion in the BlueOvalSK, which indicates that there is $2 billion more ($4 billion, including Ford's part) to be spent on another - not announced yet - project. It could be another gigafactory in the U.S. or in Europe.

""Right after the Board of Directors’ meeting on September 27th (KST), SK Innovation revealed its plan to invest up to USD 6.4 billion in the BlueOvalSK battery plant by 2027 in the form of providing the capital to its US battery corporation SK Battery America (SKBA). SK Innovation announced that it would invest USD 4.45 billion in the construction these BlueOvalSK’s plants. This amount is equivalent to its 50% stake in the joint venture. The decision was made after a meeting held by the company’s Board of Directors on September 27th (KST).""

SK Innovation's plan is to install more than 200 GWh of battery manufacturing capacity by 2025 and more than 500 GWh by 2030.

Let's take a look at the details.

SK Battery America (SKBA)

The SK Battery America (SKBA) subsidiary of SK Innovation is building two battery plants at a single site in Commerce, Georgia. The first should start series production in early 2022.

HONG KONG, Feb 10 (Reuters) - The electric vehicle (EV) battery business of South Korea's SK Innovation Co Ltd (096770.KS), SK On, has begun a new funding round, targeting 2 trillion to 3 trillion won ($1.6 billion to $2.4 billion), said two people with knowledge of the matter.

The fundraising will mainly target international investors, said the people, one of whom said the company aims to finalise the fundraising as early as March-end.

SK On's last funding round was in December when it raised 2 trillion won from SK Innovation and 800 billion won from Korea Investment Private Equity and others. An eventual initial public offering (IPO) was baked into agreements, SK Innovation said.

That round valued the business at 22 trillion won, said one of the people, who declined to be identified as the information is confidential.

A spokeswoman declined to comment on valuation but said SK On expects up to an extra 500 billion won from private equity funds this year as part of the December fundraising. She said the amount and schedule for the latest fundraising have not been set. SK Innovation was not immediately available for comment.

The new call for funding represents further effort by the energy group to boost its EV battery business in anticipation of rapid electrification in the auto industry.

SK Innovation on Tuesday said it would focus spending on growing SK On this year even as the business was taking longer than it expected to turn a profit. It said SK On accounted for 15% of fourth-quarter group revenue.

SK On makes batteries in South Korea, China, Hungary and the United States for clients including Ford Motor Co (F.N), Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE) and Hyundai Motor Co (005380.KS).

It lost money last year as it navigated challenges including a global chip shortage, rises in raw material prices and labour costs, unfavourable currency exchange rates and delayed production increases at its U.S. and Hungarian factories.

It expects to book a profit in 2024, its chief financial officer said on Tuesday.

Analysts said a U.S. EV subsidy has kindled interest in battery firms targeting the United States, and that SK On's U.S. plants would be particularly appealing to global investors.

SK On's cross-town rival LG Energy Solution Ltd (373220.KS) last month offered a positive outlook in the North American market, where it sees increasing requests for made-in-USA batteries to qualify for subsidies. read more
