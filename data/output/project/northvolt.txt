Picture taken September 29, 2021. REUTERS/Helena Soderpalm./File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights\n\nSummary\n\nCompanies BlackRock, Canada Pension Plan back convertible note\n\nOmers, IMCO also help lead latest funding round\n\nClose to agreeing plan for Canadian factory - sources\n\nSTOCKHOLM/LONDON, Aug 22 (Reuters) - Swedish lithium-ion battery producer Northvolt has raised $1.2 billion from investors including BlackRock (BLK.N) and several Canadian pension plans as it prepares to build new factories in Europe and North America, its finance chief told Reuters.\n\nThe fresh funding, through a convertible note, comes as investor demand for companies set to benefit from the move to a low-carbon economy picks up pace, aided by policy initiatives in both regions to accelerate the transition.\n\n"It\'s a very capital intensive industry... finding the right mix is always hard in this new greenfield kind of transitional projects," Chief Financial Officer Alexander Hartman said in an interview.\n\nLeading the round alongside BlackRock, the world\'s biggest asset manager, were Canada Pension Plan, Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System and, as previously reported, pension investor Investment Management Corporation of Ontario.\n\n"The battery manufacturing sector has attractive growth potential driven by the accelerating adoption of battery storage and electric vehicles," said David Giordano, global head of climate infrastructure at BlackRock.\n\n"As a leading investor in the energy transition, we look forward to supporting their continued growth."\n\nOther investors to take part included Goldman Sachs (GS.N), Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE), Baillie Gifford, Swedbank Robur (SWEDa.ST), Singapore\'s GIC and Hong Kong-based Chow Tai Fook Enterprises.\n\nA number of funds to invest in the note were classed as \'dark green\' under the European Union\'s sustainable finance framework, a stamp of environmental approval that bodes well for future interest in the company, which ultimately hopes to list, Hartman said.\n\nThe fresh funds will help the firm expand its factory footprint, Hartman said. The firm currently has several factories across Europe with the latest a 600 million euros ($654 million) investment to build a plant in Germany, announced in May.\n\nWhile the company has a facility in the United States, sources said the company is close to finalising plans to build a multibillion-dollar battery factory in Canada that will be announced later this year.\n\nNorthvolt declined to comment on the factory plans.\n\nWith the latest round, Northvolt has raised more than $9 billion in debt and equity since 2017 in its bid to become Europe\'s biggest battery manufacturer, including $1.1 billion in convertible notes last year from multiple investors.\n\nIt has secured orders of over $55 billion from customers such as BMW, Fluence, Scania, Volvo Cars and Volkswagen.\n\nSeparately, Northvolt has assembled its first energy storage system products in Poland and expects to start customer deliveries from later this year.\n\n"We have a business plan... we always want to make sure we have access to the markets," Hartman said.\n\nHe declined to comment on whether the company was preparing to go public.\n\nReuters has previously reported, citing sources, that Northvolt was preparing for an initial public offering that could value the company at more than $20 billion.\n\n($1 = 0.9176 euros)\n\nReporting by Supantha Mukherjee in Stockholm and Simon Jessop in London; editing by Mark Potter\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.'}...
Article 3: {'title': 'Northvolt in 2022: where we stand', 'published_date': '2022-03-29 10:37:13+00:00', 'keywords': [], 'text': 'It is now plain to see that electric vehicles will come to occupy the majority share of new car sales in just a few decades time. Electric vehicle sales in the first quarter of 2021 rose by 140% compared to the same period in 2020. By 2030, this number is expected to be 15-25 times higher yet. Meanwhile, renewable energy has become the default option for new generating capacity in Europe.\n\nThe dynamics in play impact all corners of industry and society in an uncountable number of ways, but what is constant is widespread and tremendous demand for lithium-ion batteries.\n\nTen years ago, there was little conversation at all of Europe engaging in the enterprise of establishing its own battery industry to support this new industrial revolution. Today, that domestic battery industry is taking root â\x80\x93 valued in excess of â\x82¬250 billion by 2025 and a regular talking point of European politicians and automotive leaders alike.\n\nAlready today, itâ\x80\x99s almost inconceivable to imagine that at one time Europe never considered moving in the direction itâ\x80\x99s now taking, such is how quickly the battery industry has emerged into the fabric of new European industry.\n\nEstablishing a new, sustainable battery industry for Europe from a blank slate, as is Northvoltâ\x80\x99s mission, was always going to be a monumental task. But the progress to date speaks volumes for the momentum for systemic change exhibited by industry amidst the climate crisis.'}...

It has sparked a boom in investment as well as fierce competition among government officials seeking to lure companies to their states or provinces.\n\nU.S. allies have complained that incentives designed to create a domestic supply chain have ignited a costly subsidy arms race.'}...
