SVOLT confirms 2nd battery cell plant in Germany,2022-09-10,"SVOLT has confirmed building another cell factory for the European battery industry in Germany. The new site at Lauchhammer, Brandenburg, is a former wind turbine plant owned by Vestas. The company aims to repurpose it fast, by early 2025.

This is to make up for the delays SVOLT is now facing in Saarland. The Chinese company has been planning to produce battery cells in central Europe for some time and had confirmed factories in the German state of Saarland in November 2020. SVOLT aims to make cells near the town of Überherrn, close to a battery assembly in Heusweiler, also Saarland. However, the new plans in Brandenburg come on the back of said delays at the Saarland sites. We will come to these later.

Yet there are other reasons for Lauchhammer. Brandenburg, the state that surrounds Berlin, lies along the region’s supply chain and battery life cycle. There is, for example, the chemical company BASF which entered a partnership with SVOLT for battery materials and recycling at the end of 2021. BASF is currently building a cathode material factory, including a recycling pilot plant, in Schwarzheide, less than 7 kilometres from Lauchhammer.

SVOLT is planning to start production in Brandenburg in early 2025, Maxim Hantsch-Kramskoj, VP of Sales & Marketing of SVOLT Europe, told journalists. The company targets an initial capacity of 16 GWh.

That sounds like construction will quick (and rushed). The former Vestas site is a so-called brownfield project. SVOLT says it took over the plant, including buildings and infrastructure, from the previous owner at the end of August and will now “repurpose the majority of the existing halls”. However, rebuilding measures and extension works will also be necessary and realised in the near future, so SVOLT. The company adds that it was developing a master plan including a detailed schedule for all modernisation and building measures.

SVOLT sites in Saarland facing delays

At the same time, the construction of the Saarland sites will take much longer than planned. According to the Saarbrücker Zeitung paper, Kramskoy does not expect SVOLT to produce battery cells in Überherrn before 2027 – that is four years later than initially announced.

Even though Heusweiler builds on an existing building like Brandenburg, there would also be delays at this second Saarland site for the assembly of modules and packs, the manager said. Production was supposed to start in the middle of this year with parts from other SVOLT plants. Now the company says it will only begin assembly by February 2024.

Hantsch-Kramskoj did not detail the reasons for the delay but pointed to the project being “very complex”. Following experts, they would now reach master planning. The Saarland sites would get the time they require, he said.

SVOLT has to deliver, first from Brandenburg

Still, SVOLT has to deliver another driver for selecting the Lauchhammer site reasonably quickly. So far, PSA is confirmed as a customer and signed an option for 7 GWh as reported.

Kai-Uwe Wollenhaupt, President of SVOLT Europe & VP of SVOLT Energy Technology, said he was happy that they were able to conclude the conversations with Vestas timely and take over the site.

Mirko Buhr, Mayor of the City of Lauchhammer, also went on to “explicitly thank all those involved for their dedicated efforts to bring a successor company to the former Vestas site as swiftly as possible.”

The site offers 255,000 square metres of space, and SVOLT has the right of first refusal on an adjacent free area of another 71,000 sqm.

Hantsch-Kramskoj referred to the project as a “gigafactory” when speaking to the local press. Even if put in Tesla-speak, the new factory won’t compare to the Tesla plant in Grünheide, about 150 kilometres away.

As for synergies between the plants in Brandenburg and Saarland, SVOLT expects to utilise battery cells produced in Lauchhammer at the future assembly site in Heusweiler. At least until the Saarland cell factory comes online. SVOLT aims to produce between 22 and 32 Gwh, double the 16 GWh in Brandenburg. That is batteries for about 300,000 to 500,000 e-vehicles per year.

SVOLT has not disclosed which cells may be made in Brandenburg (and Saarland). However, the company has pushed cobalt-free battery cells since July 2019. These have undergone testing for at least two years now.

Plus, the battery maker that came out of Great Wall Motors reportedly produced a prototype batch of 20 Ah cells with a solid electrolyte based on sulphide only a few weeks ago in China. The prototype solid-state cells have an energy density of 350-400 Wh/kg. This is in line with SVOLT’s earlier tests, and the result promises a range of over 1,000 kilometres for electric cars in future.

SVOLT signs lease for battery factory in Germany,2022-12-12,"The Chinese battery manufacturer SVOLT has signed the lease for its future factory for the assembly of modules and packs at the Saarland site in Heusweiler. However, there is no mention of the future of the cell factory also planned in Saarland.

SVOLT itself says that the 15-year lease agreement underpins its long-term plans in Saarland. Parallel to the lease agreement, the company has also secured a possible right of first refusal.

The first part of the building (Production 1) is scheduled to go into use in April 2023, with the other parts of the building to follow in stages. The final completion is contractually agreed by mid-2024. SVOLT employees have already moved into the new administration building in Heusweiler.

In November 2020, SVOLT announced two projects in Saarland – on the one hand, the assembly of battery cells into modules and packs and, on the other hand, the headline-grabbing establishment of a 24 GWh cell factory in Überherrn. The statement at the time: in the former laminate park in Heusweiler – about 30 kilometres from Überherrn – operations were to start in mid-2022, in the cell factory at the end of 2023.

Cell production delayed in Germany

While according to the current announcement the delay for the assembly in Heusweiler will be less than one year, it is different for the cell factory: In September 2022 SVOLT had announced the construction of another battery factory in Brandenburg (planned production start is early 2025). In the course of this, it also became known that the construction of the cell factory in Saarland will be significantly delayed. Maxim Hantsch-Kramskoj, Vice President Sales & Marketing of SVOLT Europe, stated at the time that he did not expect cell production in Überherrn before 2027.

The assembly in Heusweiler will therefore not be carried out with locally manufactured cells, and a supply of battery cells from Lauchhammer in Brandenburg will also not be possible until 2025. Instead, cells from the Chinese SVOLT plants will probably be assembled into modules and packs there.

The plant in Heusweiler in the former ‘Laminate Park’ was converted by the Goldbeck company as a general contractor on behalf of the Batteriefabrik Heusweiler (PBH) project company. PBH is itself a spin-off of SHS-Strukturholding Saar. The aim is to continue to use the existing buildings on the site in the best possible way in terms of sustainability and to keep the conversion measures to a minimum. Thus, the centrally located building complex with a total area of around 23,000 square metres and the administration building will be retained. Some areas have been deconstructed to make room for new buildings with about 13,000 square metres as well as necessary logistics areas and outdoor facilities.

“With the signing of the lease agreement, we are underpinning our long-term plans in Saarland, which are a key element of SVOLT’s European expansion strategy,” says Kai-Uwe Wollenhaupt, President SVOLT Europe & Vice President SVOLT Energy Technology. “The plant in Heusweiler will be the first location in Europe to directly supply our customers with battery packs and modules. I would like to thank all the partners involved and am particularly pleased that the first employees have already been able to move into the office buildings in Eiweiler.”

Anke Rehlinger, Minister-President of the German state of Saarland, added: “Preserving existing jobs and creating new ones: That is the primary goal of the state government. The establishment of SVOLT will bring many new jobs and is a great opportunity for Saarland to play in the premier league of electromobility.”
