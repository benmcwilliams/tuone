Northvolt Ett,2023-07-04,"At the Bergsbyn industrial area in Skellefteå, Northvolt Ett is being built. This is where Northvolt will have most of its production. The factory will be one of Europe's largest battery factories, producing the world's greenest lithium-ion batteries for electric cars and energy storage. The area is as large as 71 football fields and Northvolt's establishment will generate about 4,000 jobs in Skellefteå when the factory is fully completed in 2026.

The construction started in 2018 and is divided into stages. The first stage included four production buildings that were completed at the end of 2021.

When the entire Northvolt Ett is in operation, the factory will be able to deliver batteries equivalent to 60-gigawatt hours per year, which is enough to manufacture about one million electric cars.

Between 2021 and 2022 new roads have been built adjacent to the area to create better traffic flows. An extension of Torsgatan from Northvolt to road 372 has been constructed, as well as a new roundabout from road 372 to the entrance of the area.

To ensure that employees feel safe cycling or walking to work, a new pedestrian and cycle path has been built. It runs parallel to Torsgatan and was completed in early 2023.

On site you can also find Revolt Ett, Europe's only large-scale recycling factory. It has he capacity to recycle materials needed for battery production and is the key to creating the world's greenest batteries.

Northvolt rolls out Europe’s first ‘gigafactory-era’ car battery,2021-12-29,"Electric cars have gone mainstream in Europe – they accounted for nearly a fifth of all car purchases in the UK last month. Yet one piece has been missing up to now: European batteries.

That is now changing. On Tuesday night, Northvolt, a startup, produced its first lithium ion battery cell at a plant in northern Sweden. It is the first of a series of new factories that investors hope will allow Europe to carve out a big proportion of the electric vehicle market – and weaken the stranglehold built up by manufacturers in China, Japan and Korea.

The Northvolt Ett site will be the first European-owned plant to produce at so-called gigafactory scale. Gigafactories are generally considered to be those capable of producing enough batteries each year to provide about 15 gigawatt hours (GWh) of cumulative storage.

Only two large battery factories are operational in Europe, according to Benchmark Mineral Intelligence (BMI), a battery data company: a factory in Wrocław, Poland, run by Korea’s LG, and another owned by Korea’s Samsung near Budapest in Hungary.

Yet there are 25 gigafactories planned for the continent by 2030, according to BMI, as the industry races to keep up with soaring demand for electric cars. Nine of those are owned by Asian manufacturers, which control most of the global supply.

The UK is arguably further behind the rest of Europe, with plans for only two gigafactories. One will be a major expansion of a small battery plant in Sunderland by the Chinese company Envision, while the Glencore-backed startup Britishvolt is attempting to secure funding for a homegrown rival in nearby Blyth.

Local authorities in Coventry are trying to find a manufacturer for a third site at the local airport, but nobody has yet stepped forward – a situation that has cast a shadow over the prospects of the UK automotive sector as it strives to replace the declining internal combustion engine industry.

Simon Moores, BMI’s chief executive, hailed Northvolt’s first cell as “Europe’s first gigafactory-era lithium ion battery”.

Despite its startup status, Northvolt has gained heavyweight financial backing from Volkswagen, the world’s biggest car producer, and the investment bank Goldman Sachs. Its $2.75bn (£2.1bn) funding round in June valued it at $12bn.

Northvolt hopes to rapidly expand production at the plant at Skellefteå in northern Sweden to produce 60GWh a year – enough to supply batteries for a million electric cars. Commercial deliveries will start in the new year.

The startup already boasts contracts worth $30bn with big European companies including the carmakers BMW, Volkswagen, Volvo Cars and Polestar, the truck manufacturer Scania, and the energy storage firm Fluence. Carmakers are belatedly ramping up electric vehicle production to meet tightening emissions targets as well as the challenge from their US rival, Tesla, which has built its own battery and car plant in Berlin.

Peter Carlsson, Northvolt’s chief executive and co-founder, said the production of the lithium ion battery on Tuesday represented“a great milestone”.

“Of course, this first cell is only the beginning,” he said. “Over the course of the coming years, we look forward to Northvolt Ett expanding its production capacity greatly to enable the European transition to clean energy.”",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/dec/29/northvolt-rolls-out-europes-first-gigafactory-era-car-battery

North Swedish battery gigafactory expands before production start,,"The gigafactory outside Skellefteå in northern Sweden has not yet started production before funding to a 50% expansion of capacity is on the table. Northvolt, branding its factory to produce World’s greenest battery, will start output later this year, with customers like VW, BMW, and Scania hungry to buy whatever the production lines can provide.

Between 2019 and 2027, the size of the global market for electric vehicles (EV) is expected to boom almost five-fold. This year, more than 4 million battery-powered cars will be sold, with an accumulated number by 2027 believed to reach more than 230 million units.

Limited production of batteries is one factor that could be limiting the size of the market.

As recently reported by the Barents Observer, northern Sweden takes a lead position in the new industrial revolution, shifting to technologies aimed to slow climate change. The regions of Västerbotten and Norrbotten alone are expected to get 10,000 new workplaces with carbon-free production of steel, mining of metals, and battery production.

Northvolt’s factory in Skellefteå alone will count for 6,000 employees. All production will be based on renewable energy like hydropower, windmills and solar.

The $2,75 billion raised in new equity comes from the Swedish pension funds, OMERS Capital Market alongside existing investors in Northvolt like Goldman Sachs and VW Group, the company says in a press statement.

VW is one of Northvolt’s main customers and has already ordered batteries for $14 billion to supply the group’s wide range of electric vehicles from Audi, Skoda, Seat, Porsche and VW.

In total, Northvolt has now raised more than $6,5bn in equity and debt.

“We have a solid base of world-class investors and customers on-board who share Northvolt’s mission of building the world’s greenest battery to enable the European transition to renewable energy,” says Peter Carlsson, CEO and Co-Founder of Northvolt.

CFO of Northvolt, Alexander Hartman, said: “This is a new European industry in the making and it will require significant investments over the coming decade. It is encouraging to see that the investor community has identified the opportunity early, and we hope to see more investments throughout the value chain over the coming years.”",https://thebarentsobserver.com/en/industry-and-energy/2021/06/north-swedish-battery-gigafactory-expands-production-start
