Article 1: {'title': "Check Out Europe's Largest EV Battery Gigafactory In Poland", 'published_date': 'None', 'keywords': [], 'text': 'LG Chem\'s LG Energy Solution (LGES) has recently released an interesting PR video about its lithium-ion battery cell factory in Poland, which gives us a rare insight into this large gigafactory.\n\nThe site, located in Wrocław in western Poland, is actually the largest EV battery plant in Europe and one of the largest in the world.\n\nThe company does not say what is the current output, but in the European Investment Bank (EIB)\'s info from 2020 it was said that the initial manufacturing capacity of 35 GWh/year will be expanded to 65 GWh/year.\n\nAn example volume of 10 GWh corresponds to 200,000 battery packs (50 kWh each).\n\nThat\'s a massive volume and probably the biggest LGES battery factory so far. It\'s believed that this single site is able to provide a sufficient amount of batteries for several hundred thousand electric vehicles annually.\n\nAs we can see in the video, there are a lot of advanced and highly automated production processes. The South Korean company notes also that the plant is powered by 100% carbon neutral electricity.\n\nThe video includes also a map of where the batteries are exported. As we can see, LGES batteries are used by a pretty high number of manufacturers, including Audi, BMW, Daimler, Jaguar, Porsche, Renault, Stellantis, Volkswagen and Volvo:\n\nThe list of customers actually might be higher than shown on the map, depending on when it was updated.\n\nAccording to the recent press release, Poland has attracted the investment, supporting it with €95 million ($104 million) aid, which according to the European Commission, was confirmed as necessary.\n\n"Therefore, without the €95 million Polish support, LG Chem would have opted to invest outside of the European Economic Area."\n\nOther European countries also are trying to attract gigafactory investments. One of the most successful over the past several years was Hungary, which was selected by SK Innovation\'s SK On and Samsung SDI.\n\nCurrently there are double-digit number of battery gigafactories under construction/planned in Europe, compared to basically none a decade ago.'}...

In fact, LGES Wroclaw’s plant has already completed 100% transition to renewable energy (RE100) in 2019 through Green Pricing Scheme and purchase of Renewable Energy Certificate.\n\n“LG Energy Solution Wroclaw is trying to create a new dimension of the global automotive market. We see not only the growing demand for batteries, but also how important it is to take action on climate change, and we are pleased that our activities are being recognized and appreciated,” said Sukwon Choi, President of LG Energy Solution Wroclaw.\n\nNow in place for four consecutive years, E-Mobility Leader Award is hosted by the Polish Alternative Fuels Association (PSPA), a non-governmental organization composed of over 120 companies from the entire e-mobility value chain, along with industry experts and institutions. This year, four winners were selected through analyzing candidates’ responses to the survey questionnaire prepared by PwC, as well as assessing their investment in research and plans for further development of zero-emission transport.\n\nESWA’s win is yet another representation of LGES’s proactive response to climate change. So far, all of its global business sites have joined RE100 (Renewable Electricity 100%) – a global initiative committed to using 100% renewable energy by 2050. LGES aims to beat the deadline by 20 years and transition all businesses to 100% renewable energy by 2030. Manufacturing facilities in Wroclaw (Poland) and Michigan (U.S.) have already achieved RE100 in 2019 and 2020, respectively, and two LGES plants in Nanjing (China) are also expected to do so within this year. Based on this series of accomplishments, LGES was recently designated as a member of Advisory Committee of RE100 Board of Directors.\n\nIn addition to transitioning to renewable energy, LGES is also putting efforts in reusing and recycling batteries. It is not only developing technologies for battery reuse in ESS (Energy Storage System), but also building a closed-loop system that enables extracting and recycling of raw materials from used batteries.\n\n“Our mission toward RE100 is becoming more important as we expand our investment in renewable energy, and more customers and investors asking us to take actions against climate change,” said LG Energy Solution in a statement. “Batteries are central products in the carbon-neutral society, and accordingly, LGES will continue to establish exemplary practices in reducing greenhouse gas (GHG),” added the company spokesperson.'}...
