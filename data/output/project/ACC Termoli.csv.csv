ACC to build next battery factory in Italy for Stellantis,2022-03-23,"Stellantis has officially confirmed plans to build a third Automotive Cells Company (ACC) battery factory in Termoli, Italy. For this purpose, Stellantis’ existing engine plant will be converted into a battery factory.

By 2030, the joint venture of Stellantis, Total and, since September 2021, Mercedes-Benz, aim for total battery cell capacities of at least 120 GWh. The Termoli plant will have a capacity of 40 GWh in this, while two other ACC plants in Douvrin (France) and Kaiserslautern (Germany) are planned to be upgraded from their initial 24 GWh each to 40 GWh each to complete the bill.

The move to turn the Termoli engine plant into a battery cell factory had been in the offing for a long time. At the “EV Day” last July, Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares confirmed that the group had concluded a corresponding agreement on the future of Termoli with the Italian government.

“We are grateful to everyone involved in this investment to secure the future of the great community in Termoli,” Tavares now says, according to the latest news release. “Transforming the existing plant to help support a more sustainable future positions ACC as the European leader in battery manufacturing and reaffirms, thanks to the collaboration with the Ministry of Economic Development, Italy’s role in supporting Stellantis’ transformation to a sustainable mobility tech company.”

It is unknown when Stellantis or ACC will comment on further plans for Termoli and the potential sites 4 and 5. So far, the finalisation of plans for Termoli is still “subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals”, Stellantis writes.

What is clear, however, is that the entry of Mercedes-Benz is now signed and sealed, and in this case, the regulatory approvals have been granted. The “agreement to include Mercedes-Benz as a new equal partner with TotalEnergies/Saft and Stellantis” has been concluded, according to the statement.

Update 29 June 2022

Details on the timetable for Automotive Cells Company’s (ACC) third battery factory in Termoli, Italy, have emerged following a union representative meeting with Stellantis. The conversion of Stellantis’ current engine plant in Termoli into a battery factory will begin in 2024, with production to start by 2026. ACC expects the battery factory to reach total capacity in 2030 with around 2,000 employees.

However, the schedule will also significantly impact employment at the site. Since Stellantis will phase out engine production in large parts in 2024, but battery production is not to start on a smaller scale until 2026, the union expects layoffs. According to Reuters, up to 1,000 employees will lose their job at the peak before 2,000 workers are expected to return to the plant in 2030. According to union sources, some “premium” internal combustion engines will still be built until 2026 – but with the start of battery production, that will also be the end of the line there, so that the areas can also be converted as a result.

Gianluca Ficco of UILM told Reuters that Stellantis had assured unions that all Termoli workers would be employed at the new Gigafactory. “This is good, but not enough, clearly we want a formal and binding commitment by ACC,” he said. “Then we’ll have to sort out how to manage temporary layoffs.” In addition to retraining, employees will be offered to work at the battery plant in Douvrin, France, for up to six months.

A Stellantis spokesman confirmed to the news agency that unions had been given an update on development plans for Termoli but did not comment on the detailed information.

Stellantis will phase out current productions at Termoli from the beginning of 2024, while initial operations of the new gigafactory should start in 2026, Italy's main metal-mechanic unions said in a joint statement after meeting the company.

The transition will cause an expected layoff peak in 2025, involving around 1,000 workers, while the facility's whole workforce, around 2,000 people, is expected to be again fully employed by 2030, when operations at the new gigafactory are expected to run at full capacity, the unions said.

Gianluca Ficco of UILM said Stellantis had reassured unions that all Termoli's workers will be employed in the new gigafactory.

""This is good but not enough, clearly we want a formal and binding commitment by ACC,"" he said. ""Then we'll have to sort out how to manage temporary lay-offs.""

A spokesman for Stellantis told Reuters the company gave unions an update about development plans for the Termoli site, during an interlocutory meeting.

Unions added that production of some ""premium"" internal combustion engines would continue ""for some years"" beyond 2026.

As part of the retraining program for employees, the group will offer them the possibility to work for up to six months in the its French gigafactory in Douvrin, unions said.

"Stellantis' battery plans take shape in Italy, Canada",2022-03-23,"Summary

Companies Stellantis JV ACC to build battery plant in Italy

Total investment around 2.3 bln euros

LGES and Stellantis set up JV for Canada gigafactory

Total investment more than $4.1 billion

ACC to raise capacity of European plants to 120 GWh

MILAN/OTTAWA, March 23 (Reuters) - Stellantis (STLA.MI)took significant steps in its battery production plans in Europe and North America on Wednesday as carmakers race to meet rising demand for electric vehicles.

The company said its Automotive Cells Company (ACC) joint venture with Mercedes-Benz (MBGn.DE) and TotalEnergies (TTEF.PA) would build a battery plant in Italy and boost its capacity in Europe.

Separately, South Korea's LG Energy Solution (LGES) (373220.KS) said it would invest $1.48 billion to set up a joint venture with Stellantis to produce batteries in Canada.

The total investment will be more than $4.1 billion, which Innovation Minister Francois-Philippe Chamapagne said was the largest ever in the Canadian auto sector. Officials did not immediately say how much the federal and provincial governments were contributing. read more

The Canadian plant, to be built just across the border from Detroit, aims for an annual production capacity in excess of 45 gigawatt hours (GWh) and will create an estimated 2,500 new jobs in the Windsor area, the companies said.

The moves are part of a plan by the world's fourth largest carmaker to have five battery plants, two in North America and three in Europe, where it has already announced so-called 'gigafactories' in France and Germany, also being built via ACC.

They come as rivals also move forward with battery production plans and as the car industry struggles with chip shortages and other supply chain disruptions.

Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) on Wednesday picked a site near Valencia for its planned battery cell plant in Spain, while Tesla (TSLA.O) on Tuesday launched a factory in Germany, its first European hub. read more

ACC said on Wednesday it would convert an existing Stellantis engine plant in the southern Italian townof Termoli into a battery facility as agreed in a March 21 memorandum of understanding with Italian authorities.

The total investment for Termoli would amount to 2.3 billion euros ($2.5 billion), including 370 million euros in public funds, Italy's deputy industry minister said in a statement.

The plant in Canada comes as the country, rich in key materials for EV battery production, has been wooing battery makers to safeguard the future of its car manufacturing industry as the world seeks to cut emissions.

Ontario is geographically close to U.S. automakers in Michigan and Ohio, and General Motors Co (GM.N), Ford Motor Co (F.N) and Stellantis NV have all announced plans to make electric vehicles at factories in Ontario.

""This is going to make Windsor the home of Canada's first EV battery manufacturing plant, a plant that will be manufacturing hundreds of thousands of batteries,"" Champagne said. ""It's great news for the entire auto sector in Canada.""

Separately, ACC said it would increase its industrial capacity to at least 120 gigawatt hours (GWh) by 2030, versus an initial target of 48 GWh, and scale up the development and production of next-generation high-performance battery cells and modules.

The plan will involve an investment of more than 7 billion euros, ACC said, and will include bringing production capacity at its French and German plants to 40 GWh each, from the 24 GWh initially planned.

This suggests the Termoli battery plan would also have a capacity of 40 GWh. Tesla's Berlin plant is aiming for an eventual capacity of 50 GWh.

Presenting its first business plan earlier this month, Stellantis said it aimed to sell 5 million battery electric vehicles a year by 2030. It also increased its planned battery capacity by 140 GWh to approximately 400 GWh, through its five gigafactories and additional supply contracts.
