"CATL announces its second European battery plant in Debrecen, Hungary",2022-08-12,"Contemporary Amperex Technology Co., Limited (CATL) officially announced it will invest 7.34 billion euros to build a 100 GWh battery plant in Debrecen of east Hungary, which is also its second battery plant in Europe following its German plant. Subject to the shareholder meeting approval, construction of the first production facilities will start within this year.

Covering an area of 221 hectares in the Southern Industrial Park of Debrecen, the project will supply both cells and modules to European automakers.

Debrecen is located at the heart of Europe, and with close proximity to some auto plants of its customers such as Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Stellantis and Volkswagen, CATL’s Debrecen plant will enable it to better cope with the battery demands of the European market, improve its global production network development, and help accelerate e-mobility and energy transition in Europe.

As part of its commitment to reducing the carbon footprint in battery manufacturing, CATL will use electricity from renewable energies, and is considering developing solar power with local partners in the country.

To build a sustainable and circular battery value chain, CATL is also examining the possibility of joining forces with local partners to establish facilities for battery materials in Europe.

“There is no doubt that our plant in Debrecen will enable us to further sharpen our competitive edge, better respond to our European customers, and accelerate the transition to e-mobility in Europe,” said Dr. Robin Zeng, founder and Chairman of CATL. “The greenfield project in Hungary will be a giant leap in CATL’s global expansion, and also an important step in our efforts to make an outstanding contribution to the green energy drive for humankind.”

Péter Szijjártó, Hungarian Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade, said: “Both the global and the European economies have been faced with tremendous challenges recently. We in Hungary have a clear goal to be a local exception from the continental recession. The best tool to achieve this goal is to attract state-of-the-art investments in the most revolutionary branch of the automotive industry, namely electromobility. We are proud that CATL decided to execute the biggest ever greenfield investment in the history of Hungary. We have recently become one of the leading battery production sites of the world and with this huge investment we further strengthen our position.”

The new project was well received from CATL’s European customers. Markus Schäfer, Member of the Board of Management of Mercedes-Benz Group AG, CTO responsible for development and procurement, said: “This new state-of-the art European CATL plant in Hungary is another milestone for the scale-up of our EV production together with our key partners. With CATL we have a technology-leader as our partner to provide us - as the first and biggest customer of the new plant’s initial capacity - with top-notch CO2 neutral battery cells for our next generation EVs in Europe, hence following our local-to-local approach in procurement. We’re proud to see our Ambition 2039 supported by CATL’s commitment to CO2 neutral production in Hungary.”",https://chemicalparks.eu/news/catl-european-battery-plant-debrecen-hungary
A Hungarian Town Seethes Over a Giant Chinese Battery Plant,2023-03-15,"The small-town mayor, long a loyal foot soldier for Hungary’s governing party, recently committed what he described as “political suicide,” throwing himself in the path of an enormous $7.8 billion Chinese battery factory project promoted by his dissent-intolerant prime minister, Viktor Orban.

“It is like lying in front of a steamroller,” Zoltan Timar, the mayor of Mikepercs, said of his decision to side with residents opposed to the project, which his Fidesz party championed. “I just hope it won’t roll over me too soon.”

The factory, which would be the biggest of its kind in Europe, is the fruit of a yearslong diplomatic and economic tilt by Mr. Orban away from the West toward countries like China and Russia. It promises to put Hungary at the center of a wrenching and, for some, highly profitable green transition, with electric cars leading the way.

But residents in Mikepercs, a Fidesz stronghold in eastern Hungary, are seething over the arrival on nearby farmland of bulldozers and dump trucks preparing the way for the Chinese plant. Many worry the project would create pollution, drain their water supply and bring an influx of Chinese and other foreign workers.",https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/15/world/europe/hungary-china-battery-plant.html
CATL Will Build Massive 100 GWh Battery Plant In Hungary,,"Contemporary Amperex Technology Co., Limited (CATL) officially announced today a massive new battery plant investment in Europe.

The Chinese manufacturer intends to invest €7.34 billion ($7.5 billion) to build a 100 GWh EV battery plant in Debrecen, Hungary. Once approved at the shareholder meeting, construction of the first production facilities will start before the end of this year.

That would be CATL's second battery plant in Europe, as the first one (much smaller) is expected to start production this year in Erfurt, Germany (8 GWh annually initially and 14 GWh annually in the future). This project was started in 2019.

According to CATL, the factory in Hungary will produce cells and modules (undisclosed chemistry) for European automakers. The location is in relatively close proximity to some plants of CATL's customers, including Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Stellantis and Volkswagen. Mercedes-Benz specifically said that it is the first and the biggest customer of the new plant’s initial capacity.

The company explains that the new 100 GWh plant will ""enable it to better cope with the battery demands of the European market, improve its global production network development, and help accelerate e-mobility and energy transition in Europe.""

The factory will be powered by renewable electricity sources. The Chinese investment (the largest ever in the region) is expected to create up to 9,000 jobs.

According to the press release, there is also a potential to ""establish facilities for battery materials in Europe"", which means that we might see more CATL investments.

Dr. Robin Zeng, founder and Chairman of CATL said:

“There is no doubt that our plant in Debrecen will enable us to further sharpen our competitive edge, better respond to our European customers, and accelerate the transition to e-mobility in Europe. The greenfield project in Hungary will be a giant leap in CATL’s global expansion, and also an important step in our efforts to make an outstanding contribution to the green energy drive for humankind.”

CATL reportedly vetting sites for US battery production to support BMW and Ford,2022-05-06,"A recent report states that global battery conglomerate CATL is in the final stages of vetting potential sites to bring EV battery production to the US. The move would mark the company’s first entry into the second largest automotive market in the world, and the new facilities would provide cells to BMW AG and Ford Motor Company for their EV production stateside.

Contemporary Amperex Technology Co Ltd., better known as CATL, is a global energy technology company and the leading EV battery manufacturer in China. Beyond Asia, the company has retained its crown as the world’s largest battery manufacturer by installed capacity for a fifth-straight year.

In addition to recent projects to implement battery recycling and net-zero carbon manufacturing facilities in China, CATL has begun to expand outside of its home country. Its first announcement came this past April with plans for an 8 GWh battery plant in Germany.

A week later, CATL announced a $6 billion investment to mine, manufacture, and recycle batteries in Indonesia, expanding its global reach further. According to the latest report, CATL plans to soon be manufacturing EV batteries in the US as well, and could be providing cells to US automakers assembling nearby.

Could CATL be making batteries in the US for Ford and BMW?

According to a report from Reuters, sources close to the matter say CATL is in the final stages of determining potential sites to set up US manufacturing. Two possible locations include South Carolina and Kentucky, where BMW AG and Ford Motor Company currently have assembly plants.

According to sources who asked not to be identified, talks are ongoing, but CATL would provide battery cells to both BMW and Ford from facilities erected near their respective assembly plants. One source elaborated, stating that CATL is looking to commence battery production for BMW in South Carolina by 2026.

In a statement, current CATL customer BMW shared it is “intensively examining the possibility of establishing a battery factory” in the US, as well as acquiring battery materials stateside. The company also said it is in talks with several partners regarding the factory.

Last September, Ford announced a massive EV production project called Blue Oval City in Tennessee, which included a battery plant with the help of SK Innovation. Additionally, the two parties shared plans for a second plant near Ford’s assembly facilities in Louisville, Kentucky.

With electric truck demand beginning to soar for the American automaker, additional battery cells in Tennessee or Louisville make sense. Considering Tennessee is where the electrified trucks are currently planned to be produced, a CATL plant feels like a better fit.

However, that isn’t to say Ford won’t refurbish its Kentucky plants currently assembling ICE vehicles like the Escape, Expedition, and F Series to support EVs, too, especially since it’s already building a battery plant there with SK. Ford declined to comment.

CATL’s expedited expansion to the US comes at an opportune time, following the Department Energy’s recent $3 billion program to support local battery manufacturing – part of the Biden administration’s larger $7.5 billion infrastructure bill approved last year.

CATL to build battery factory in Hungary – with Mercedes as major customer,2022-08-12,"The Chinese battery cell manufacturer CATL will build another cell factory in Europe. The second location after Erfurt is Debrecen in Hungary. CATL already has an important customer on its hands: the cell factory is to supply the Mercedes-Benz vehicle plants in Germany and Hungary with batteries.

Hungary was already in the running when the decision was made for the first European location near Erfurt. For some time now, there have been repeated reports that CATL was looking for a second location in Eastern Europe – Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia or Hungary were specifically mentioned. In June there were rumours that CATL had already acquired a 200-hectare plot of land near Debrecen and had advertised the first jobs.

It has now been confirmed that CATL will build a plant there. According to the Chinese company, a plant with a planned annual capacity of 100 gigawatt-hours is to be built there. The ground-breaking ceremony is to take place this year. Over the years, CATL will invest 7.34 billion euros in the site. The new CATL factory in Hungary will produce battery cells and modules for European car manufacturers.

CATL itself says that the Debrecen plant is “close to the OEMs of Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Stellantis, Volkswagen and other customers”, which will help CATL better meet the needs of Europeans.

“There is no doubt that our plant in Debrecen will enable us to further sharpen our competitive edge, better respond to our European customers, and accelerate the transition to e-mobility in Europe,” said Robin Zeng, founder and chairman of CATL. “The greenfield project in Hungary will be a giant leap in CATL’s global expansion, and also an important step in our efforts to make an outstanding contribution to the green energy drive for humankind.”

Mercedes-Benz to be major customer for CATL plant

While the German publication Germany Trade & Invest wrote in June that it could be a challenge to find a customer in view of the numerous battery projects announced in Europe, CATL has already solved this problem: According to Mercedes-Benz itself, the new CATL plant in Debrecen will supply battery cells for European production sites in Germany and Hungary. Battery production in Europe strengthens Mercedes-Benz’s “local-for-local strategy”.

The Stuttgart-based carmaker already relies on battery cells from CATL on a large scale, for example in the EQS and EQE. However, since CATL does not currently manufacture cells in Europe, they are imported from China. “This new state-of-the art European CATL plant in Hungary is another milestone for the scale-up of our EV production together with our key partners. With CATL we have a technology-leader as our partner to provide us – as the first and biggest customer of the new plant’s initial capacity – with top-notch CO2 neutral battery cells for our next generation EVs in Europe, hence following our local-to-local approach in procurement,” says Markus Schäfer, Member of the Board of Management of Mercedes-Benz Group AG, Chief Technology Officer, responsible for Development & Purchasing.

How many cells Mercedes will buy from the new plant and what share this will have of the plant’s total capacity is not clear from the Mercedes announcement. The cell type is also not mentioned in more detail. Mercedes has so far only stated in general terms that the cells will be used in the next generation of electric vehicles in Europe.

Mercedes plans to build eight cell factories worldwide, four of them in Europe, for its own battery demand of 200 GWh by the end of the decade together with partners. Last September, Mercedes bought into the ACC battery joint venture between Saft and Stellantis. ACC is building three battery factories in Europe, in Douvrin, France, in Kaiserslautern and in Termoli, Italy. The new CATL factory in Hungary would give Mercedes four European battery plants.

Mercedes builds the majority of its electric models in Germany and Hungary: the EQC and EQE come off the production line in Bremen, the EQS in Sindelfingen, the EQA in Rastatt and the EQB in Kecskemét, Hungary. Currently, of the models available in Europe, only the EQV (Spain) and EQS SUV (Tuscaloosa, USA) are built in other countries.

CATL itself announced that it is discussing the possibility of setting up a battery materials factory in Hungary with local partners to promote recycling and the sustainable development of the battery value chain. Other companies also want to produce battery precursors in Hungary. The South Korean battery materials manufacturer EcoPro BM had announced in December that it would also manufacture over 100,000 tonnes of cathode materials in Debrecen in the future. The Japanese chemical company Toray and LG Chem had announced a factory for battery separator foils in Hungary in November. The Korean battery cell manufacturer SK On is already building and operating battery plants in Hungary.
