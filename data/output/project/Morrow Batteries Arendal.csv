Morrow Batteries' Industrial Update November 2023: Press Release and Webcast Invitation,,"Reaching significant operational and technological milestones, verified B-sample batteries pushing Morrow close to production start

Morrow Batteries ASA (""Morrow"") will be the first manufacturer to commence GWh scale battery production in Norway at its first factory in Arendal in mid-2024. The plan is supported by several important milestones so far this year, including the verification of the company's LFP B-samples and the installation of equipment in the GWh factory in Arendal.

«Our operational progress, including our LFP B-samples completing industry-standard tests, brings Morrow to the production phase. This proves the quality of Morrow's industrial platform and commitment to becoming a leading battery producer in Europe"", says CEO of Morrow Batteries Lars Christian Bacher.

Morrow Batteries is an industrial battery technology company scaling up to 43 GWh production capacity in Southern Norway (Arendal), with a research centre in Grimstad and a Customer Qualification Line in South Korea.

Verified B-samples de-risking production start-up

In late October, Morrow produced and certified LFP B-sample batteries through internal acceptance tests, and the company is shipping 300-500 certified LFP B-samples to potential customers over the coming months.



«I am proud of what the team has accomplished in a matter of months. We are approaching production start, which cements the solidity of our roadmap to profitability through a targeted tier 1 operating cost structure and economies of scale."" Bacher says.

The operational progress this year is significantly de-risking the scale-up of manufacturing. The first factory building in Arendal (MCF) has been set up, and containers with premium battery manufacturing equipment are now being delivered weekly from Korea for installation. The company's customer qualification line has delivered strong and promising yield results, and the recent certification of the LFP B-samples has further reduced the operational risk.

Next-generation battery firming up

The company is progressing on its dual product and battery development strategy, approaching the production start of first-generation batteries and launching Morrow's second-generation batteries (LNMO-X and LNMO-C).

Morrow Batteries announced after the summer that it expects to produce the first next-generation LNMO-X batteries at its Customer Qualification Line during Q1 2024. The cell is a world-first with the configuration of this material.

""Morrow's deliverables prove that our stepwise scale-up strategy is working. This enables us to start production of LFP batteries next year and at the same time develop next-generation batteries with significant quality and sustainability features"", says Bacher.

Highlights so far in 2023 include:

Completed multiple industry acceptance tests on LFP B-samples.

Morrow has completed the construction of Norway's first battery GWh scale factory, and the production will start in the middle of 2024.

Achieving 86% yield at the Customer Qualification line while targeting tier 1 operating cost.

Scandinavia's largest battery research centre has opened in Grimstad, set to develop Morrow's next-generation batteries.

Raised a NOK 567m convertible loan from Å Energi, Siemens, ABB, and PKA by mid-May. Raised up to EUR 70 million (approximately NOK 800 million) through a private placement guaranteed by the company's largest owners in September.

Started preparing for the project financing for Eyde 1, the 14 GWh factory, which will be the next construction stage on the approximately 1 million square meters Morrow has access to in Arendal, Norway.

Appointed Steffen Føreid as the new Chief Financial Officer, bringing considerable capital markets and strategic management expertise, setting the stage for Morrow's expansive industrial growth.

Receiving the first shipment of battery production equipment, verifying being on route to start large-scale battery production in the first half of 2024.

Invitation to presentation of Industrial Update 2023

Morrow Batteries will host an investor webcast presenting the industrial update for 2023 on November 24, 2023. The presentation starts at 09:30am CET. Management will be represented by CEO Lars Christian Bacher, COO Dr. Andreas Maier and Dr. Ronny Gløckner, Head of Development.

Morrow Batteries Signs Final Agreement with Arendal Municipality for 42gwh Battery Cell Factory,2021-05-28 17:30:00+00:00,"Morrow Batteries signs final agreement with Arendal Municipality for 42GWh battery cell factory.

Morrow Batteries formalise the partnership with Arendal municipality for the establishment of its 42GWh battery cell factory. The agreement was unanimously approved by Arendal City Council.

The cell factory will be located in Eyde Energy Park which is right at the centre of the Battery coast. The agreement ensures access to approximately 1 square kilometre land.

Terje Andersen, CEO of Morrow Batteries.

The agreement with Arendal comes as a result of good cooperation and solid political support.

“Eyde Energy Park provides an ideal setup for us and meets all the fundamental requirements for a large-scale battery cell factory, such as access to green energy, infrastructure, skilled labor force and raw materials. We look forward to continue our collaboration with Arendal municipality to establish the worlds most sustainable giga factory”.

Over 19 different plots of land were evaluated before Morrow selected Arendal on southern coast of Norway as the site for their giga factory. Morrow signed a letter of intent just before Christmas. This has now been formalized in the form of a binding agreement, sign by both parties and unanimous supported by Arendal City Council.

Robert Cornelis Nordli, Major of Arendal.

The establishment of Morrow at Eyde Energy Park in Arendal is the beginning of one of the most important events in modern time for municipality of Arendal and its 300-year long history.

“We are therefore pleased that the final agreement now is signed. The area is regulated for industrial purposes, so everything is ready for the establishment of Morrow’s battery cell factory”

Start of construction in 2023

Morrow will start building the factory (first module) in 2023, with production of battery cells starting in late 2024. All modules, in total four, will be completed in 2026 and will demand minimum 315 MW of electricity.

“The location allows us to build our facilities with minimal CO2-footprint and with minimal impact on the environment. We will reclaim a former land fill as a parking space for the employees and is utilising already cleared land for the first factory module. The land is already regulated for industrial activities”, says Andersen

Planned and designed by international experts

Exyte has supported Morrow Batteries in the concept design of the giga-factory, and will continue to support with further detailed engineering plans. The company has experience from over 15 large scale battery projects, such as Tesla, Northvolt and LG.

Morrow will start the construction of the first giga factory module in 2022, with start of production end of 2024. Further 3 giga factory modules are planned with a total manufacturing capacity of 42 GWh.

Ideal for battery cell manufacturing

Together with industrial partners, Morrow Batteries is establishing Battery coast in the southern of Norway. An entire local ecosystem built around the battery value chain from raw materials manufacturing to recycling. The mission is to develop and manufacture the most sustainable and cost effective battery-cells in the world.

With the availability of abundant amounts of green and competitive energy and its location close to harbour and shipping routes to Europe, Eyde Energy Park is an ideal location to realise this mission.

Morrow will also co-locate their pilot factory for raw materials and cell manufacturing in Eyde Energy Park. The construction of this facility will start later this year with the aim of start of production end of 2023.

It will have direct access to transportation, raw materials and key markets. Furthermore, Morrow Battery Innovation Centre is strategically located a few kilometres away, at the campus of Agder University, providing infrastructure supporting the next generations of battery technology.
