FREYR Battery Provides Operations Update,,"FREYR achieves important interim milestone by successfully conducting automated cathode casting trials

FREYR Battery (NYSE: FREY) (“FREYR” or the “Company”), a developer of clean, next-generation battery cell production capacity, has provided an update this morning on the company’s operational progress at the Customer Qualification Plant (“CQP”) in Mo i Rana, Norway.

Successful automated cathode casting trials

Following successful adjustments to the cathode casting equipment that included updates to the vacuum system, last week, FREYR’s teams at the CQP commenced automated cathode casting runs at a minimum nozzle distance of 0.26 mm.

The CQP teams have subsequently conducted successful cathode casting runs using the cathode web and solvent slurry at fixed nozzle distances of 0.5 mm and 1.0 mm, respectively, and at speeds of 2 meters per minute while using 100 psi of casting pressure. These successful automated cathode casting runs with solvent slurry were an important precursor to completing the Casting and Unit Cell Assembly commissioning packages and the eventual start of automated CQP production.

“I am very pleased to share that our teams at the CQP have reached another important interim technical milestone,” commented Mike Brose, FREYR’s Head of the Asset Mo team. “In doing so, our people and partners have demonstrated their collective ability to systematically link small but critical steps together to achieve the required outcome. We are able to integrate this vital part of the SemiSolidTM technology platform only because of the many milestones already completed together over the last several months by the FREYR Asset Mo team, our coworkers around the world, and our valued partners and suppliers. As we look forward to 2024, FREYR’s top priority is to finalize commissioning at the CQP and to begin automated production of in-spec, customer-testable batteries. With this latest milestone behind us, we will continue to apply unwavering focus to the remaining tasks that are necessary to achieve that goal.”

CQP commissioning status and key next steps

Following the successful automated cathode casting trials, FREYR has completed handovers of 342 (88%) of the 388 discrete production line equipment commissioning and testing packages at the CQP. The test center packages and handovers to operations are all complete.

The next technical requirements to stay on track with FREYR’s anticipated completion cadence at the CQP are:

Replicate the successful automated cathode casting trials with the anode production line system; and

Integrate the casting webs across the cathode, anode, and merge units of the Casting and Unit Cell Assembly equipment using the highly complex Multi-Carrier Systems (“MCS”) to reach automated cell production.

The project is expected to be developed in multiple phases beginning with an initial battery cell production module of approximately 34 GWh at a preliminarily estimated capital investment of $1.7 billion. FREYR plans to undertake detailed plant engineering in the coming months, during which plans for the initial Gigafactory module will be finalized. The company and key stakeholders are evaluating additional value accretive upstream and downstream modules as well as a second cell production phase, which are expected to bring total capital investments to more than $2.6 billion by 2029. Over the life of the project, FREYR and its partners expect to create more than 720 U.S. jobs for highly skilled workers in Coweta County. FREYR has purchased the land for development of Giga America at the Bridgeport Industrial Park site in Coweta County, GA. The industrial zoned tract is 368 acres with options secured for further expansion. The site was selected for Giga America through a rigorous evaluation process based on key operational, logistical, and financial criteria. The Giga America site already offers substantial room for additional upstream and downstream development projects to further strengthen an anticipated strong cost position and improve the carbon footprint of the batteries produced. The development of Giga America pos itions FREYR to meet the rapidly growing customer demand for Energy Storage Systems (“ESS”) applications with U.S.-based conditional offtake partners. FREYR is seeing very strong interest for increased volume commitments through ongoing customer dialogues. FREYR is accelerating its previously planned U.S. expansion based on strong tailwinds in U.S. renewable energy development, an intensifying focus on grid stability initiatives, and the recently announced tax incentives associated with the Inflation Reduction Act. Projected U.S. demand is being augmented further by increased interest from existing and new customer dialogues in the commercial mobility and electric vehicle segments. FREYR is intensifying and broadening its financing efforts to support the expected capital commitments for the Giga America project in parallel with the ongoing construction of Giga Arctic in Mo i Rana, Norway; the evaluation of highly value accretive potential upstream and downstream modules in the Nordic region and the U.S.; and the continued development of FREYR’s organization. The State of Georgia and Coweta County are collectively providing strong financial incentives for the Giga America project. FREYR furthermore intends to apply with the U.S. Department of Energy for packages that could potentially include a grant and/or direct loan to assist with the development and possible acceleration of the project. FREYR is evaluating clean power supply solutions for Giga America with utility providers in the region, including the potential development of a dedicated solar plus storage facility. Giga America will leverage the 24M’s SemiSolid™ platform, which simplifies the production process of lithium-ion batteries significantly, enabling highly capital, labor, and energy efficient manufacturing at scale based on U.S. technology originating from MIT. FREYR’s project team in the U.S. intends to replicate the major elements of the Giga Arctic development, which will also be based on the 24M production platform, by maintaining a continuous technical dialogue with the company’s key personnel in Norway.

FREYR Battery (NYSE: FREY) (“FREYR”), a developer of clean, next-generation battery cell production capacity, has announced the selection and purchase of a site in Coweta County, Georgia for its planned Giga America battery plant. The company selected the Bridgeport Industrial Park site through a rigorous evaluation process based on key operational, logistical, and financial criteria, including the suitability of the site to co-locate modular upstream and downstream projects with the Giga America cell manufacturing facility.

FREYR is planning to initiate detailed project engineering of Giga America in the coming months. The initial phase of Giga America is planned to be a cell production module of approximately 34 GWh based on the next-generation of 24M’s U.S.-based SemiSolid™ production platform at an initial projected capital cost of $1.7 billion. The company is also evaluating value accretive upstream and downstream modules as well as additional cell production lines that are expected to bring total capital investments to more than $2.6 billion through 2029. Upon completion of all the contemplated construction phases, the Giga America complex is expected to be one of the largest battery cell manufacturing developments globally.

“Today’s landmark announcement underscores FREYR’s ambition to develop a very strong and near-term operational footprint in the United States. Expanding into the U.S. has been a foundational aspect of FREYR’s long-term strategy from our inception, and with the recent passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, we expect U.S. demand for ESS, passenger EV and other electric mobility applications to grow rapidly over the next decade,” commented FREYR’s Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer Tom Einar Jensen.

""Job creators and innovators from all over the world bring their operations to Georgia because they know they will have success here,"" said Governor Brian Kemp. ""We're proud to welcome FREYR to the Peach State as the latest company to bring transformational investments and opportunity to our communities. They will be a valued addition to our No. 1 state for business, and I look forward to their growing impact on Coweta and the surrounding region.""

We look forward to the innovation, opportunities, and success that FREYR will generate.”

In accordance with FREYR’s ambitions to accelerate development of Giga America in parallel with the ongoing construction of Giga Arctic in Mo i Rana, Norway, the company is intensifying and broadening its financing efforts. The total package of financial incentives for Giga America includes robust assistance collectively provided by The State of Georgia and Coweta County in addition to the expected production tax credits associated with the recently passed Inflation Reduction Act. Additionally, FREYR intends to apply with the U.S. Department of Energy for packages that could include a grant and/or direct loans to assist with the development of Giga America.

The U.S. energy storage market, which is already the largest in the world, is expected to experience exponential growth over the next several years. According to Rystad Energy (“Rystad”), to satisfy a 1.6-degree scenario, cumulative collective storage demand of 4.5 TWh from the U.S. and Europe will be required through 2030. Under the same scenario, Rystad expects annual collective storage demand in the U.S. and Europe to reach 1.4 TWh by 2030, which represents a 34-fold increase from projected corresponding annual 2022 demand.

“At FREYR, we are deeply committed to decarbonizing the transportation and energy sectors. As we advance our U.S. expansion plan in cooperation with our key stakeholders, we expect to make meaningful investments to spur job creation and the eventual development of localized, decarbonized supply chains in the U.S. to enhance energy security and economic activity and meet the growing demand for energy storage solutions in the U.S. market,” added Jensen.

The Giga America project will be based on the SemiSolid™ technology of FREYR’s U.S.-based licensing partner, 24M. The SemiSolid™ platform enables capital and energy efficient production of lithium-ion batteries at scale.

FREYR is currently evaluating clean power supply solutions for the Giga America project with U.S. Independent Power Producers (“IPPs”).

"FREYR Battery begins preparatory work in Vaasa, Finland",,"FREYR Battery begins preparatory work in Vaasa, Finland

New York, Oslo, Luxembourg and Vaasa, May 18, 2022, FREYR Battery (“FREYR”), a developer of clean, next-generation battery cell production capacity, has signed an agreement with the City of Vaasa, Finland, for the temporary lease of 130 hectares (1,300,000 m²) of land in the GigaVaasa area. This plot is the future site of FREYR’s planned battery cell production plant and part of the company’s strategic collaboration with the City of Vaasa to develop industrial scale battery technology and production in the country.

In 2021, FREYR signed a non-binding memorandum of understanding (“MoU”) with the City of Vaasa, providing FREYR with an exclusive right to a site for a potential battery cell plant with the aim to explore opportunities for joint site-development to accelerate supply of clean batteries in Finland. The temporary land lease agreement of the Vaasa plot is 40 hectares larger than the area FREYR reserved in the initial MoU, to increase the company’s efforts to accelerate supply to meet the expected increasing demand for localized and decarbonized battery solutions.

The agreement now enables FREYR to begin soil investigation and preparatory work as a prelude to potential construction. The lease is valid from May 1, 2022, until December 31, 2023, with the option for a one-year extension.

“This lease grants us use of 1.3 million square meters of space in Vaasa, an area that we have previously identified as ideal for our future planned Gigafactory in Finland. There is an ample supply of affordable, renewable energy in this region and convenient proximity to raw materials. That, combined with the country’s highly competent workforce, makes this land lease an important step on the path to potential development,” said Axel Thorsdal, Senior Vice President, Project Development at FREYR.

Mayor of Vaasa, Tomas Häyry, shared his perspectives on the contract and the ongoing planning efforts. “We are developing the GigaVaasa area and the battery value chain in stages, and naturally, the progress of the cell plant project is particularly significant. At the same time, road and rail line connections are being developed in the area.”

Prior to this land lease, FREYR commenced an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) for its Vaasa project. The EIA is an essential step towards understanding the impact that the proposed factory may have on the local environment. The target is to conclude the assessment procedure before the end of 2022 with a subsequent potential investment decision in Finland’s first Gigawatt hour scale battery cell facility.

“With this agreement, we can now begin the work to clear routes for our ground investigations, which include assessing the soil and the local environment, prior to any potential construction. This is a critical step in our battery development strategy in Finland,” Thorsdal adds.

The POWER Interview: FREYR Leads Wave of New Battery Manufacturing,2023-03-28 13:13:16+00:00,"Growth in the energy storage market, including the transportation sector, has spurred a ramp-up in global battery manufacturing and investment in new technologies.

Passage of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) in the U.S. has brought a flurry of announcements from foreign companies eager to build manufacturing plants in America. FREYR, a Norway-based company, late last year announced it had purchased a site in Coweta County, Georgia, for its Giga America battery plant. The company at the time said it projected an initial capital spend of $1.7 billion for the project, which it said would create some 720 jobs in the region.

South Korea-based LG Energy Solution on March 24 said it will quadruple its initial budget for a battery manufacturing plant in Queen Creek, Arizona, saying the company will spend $5.5 billion for the project. LG said that the Arizona site would have two main facilities, one for building cylindrical batteries used in electric vehicles (EVs), and another for lithium-iron-phosphate pouch-type batteries for energy storage systems. LG also recently announced construction is underway for a battery-manufacturing project in Ohio in conjunction with Honda.

The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) recently said it expects U.S. battery production will increase 20-fold by 2030 compared to 2021 levels. “A wave of new planned electric vehicle battery plants will increase North America’s battery manufacturing capacity from 55 Gigawatt-hours per year in 2021 to nearly 1,000 GWh/year by 2030,” the agency said. The DOE in a news release noted, “To optimize supply chain logistics, many battery plants will be co-located with automotive plants. Most of the planned projects in the United States are concentrated along a north-south band from Michigan to Alabama. Based on current plans, Kentucky, Tennessee, Georgia, and Michigan will see the highest growth in battery manufacturing capacity.”

Korea’s Samsung SDI, meanwhile, has announced plans for multiple U.S. projects, including a $2.5 billion facility in Indiana in partnership with Stellantis, a multi-national automotive manufacturing group.

FREYR’s Georgia factory will likely be a model for that company as well as for other U.S. battery manufacturing facilities. Tom Jensen, the company’s co-founder and CEO, said the Georgia site “underscores FREYR’s ambition to develop a very strong and near-term operational footprint in the United States. Expanding into the U.S. has been a foundational aspect of FREYR’s long-term strategy from our inception, and with the recent passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, we expect U.S. demand for ESS, passenger EV and other electric mobility applications to grow rapidly over the next decade.”

FREYR is supporting its expansion plans with the opening of a Customer Qualification Plant, or CQP, in Norway. The facility, in Mo i Rana in northern Norway, came online March 28. The CQP is energized by hydropower as part a long-term agreement with Statkraft from that company’s Rana hydropower facility.

The factory features a demonstration production line, built at the actual physical size of a normal production line in commercial operation. That will allow creation of sample sales for customers, and provide the capability to test different materials in the manufacturing process.

The building also serves as a training facility for FREYR. That will enable the company’s workers to know the challenges that could be part of the operation of the company’s planned commercial giga factories such as the one in Georgia.

“The Chapter One opening ceremony at the CQP is a major milestone for FREYR, which inaugurates the global launch of one industrial-scale production line of the 24M Technologies SemiSolid production platform at GWh scale,” said Jensen, who added that the company has planned “an investor-focused event at the CQP this summer to demonstrate automated production of clean, next-generation batteries with this ground-breaking technology.”

FREYR also has announced potential development of industrial-scale battery cell production in Vaasa, Finland, as well as the U.S. The company has said it intends to install 50 GWh of battery cell capacity by 2025, 100 GWh annual capacity by 2028, and 200 GWh of annual capacity by 2030.

The company on Tuesday also announced it has begun discussions on a potential strategic coalition with Glencore Plc, Caterpillar, Siemens AG, and Nidec Corp. “to pursue the scale up of sustainable battery solutions across Europe, North America, and beyond.”

“We are exceedingly pleased to announce the emergence of this new global strategic coalition with four premier global industrial and energy companies,” said Jensen. “This announcement represents an important first step for FREYR and our four potential global partners as we launch this commercial initiative. Ultimately, FREYR’s vision for this coalition is to accelerate the energy transition across key sectors by scaling up clean battery production from FREYR’s gigafactories under development, and to incubate and develop innovative technology solutions together.”

Jensen, as part of the company’s celebration of today’s CQP opening, answered questions from POWER about the facility and the company’s plans to expand its battery manufacturing and provide innovative technology for the energy storage and e-mobility sector.

POWER: What was behind the decision to open a manufacturing facility powered by hydro? What stands out with this CQP?

Jensen: FREYR Battery aims to provide industrial-scale clean battery solutions to reduce global emissions. Our mission is to produce green battery cells to accelerate the decarbonization of energy and transportation systems globally. One of the reasons to choose Mo i Rana in northern Norway is the availability of abundant and low-cost renewable energy. In May 2022 we signed an agreement with Statkraft, Europe’s largest producer of renewable energy, to secure [a] supply of renewable power under globally competitive terms for our operations in Mo i Rana.

We decided early to build the CQP as a full industrial-scale production line at GWh scale, as a world first for the SemiSolid technology platform. Our ambition is then to install eight of these in Giga Arctic in Mo i Rana and to replicate this in Giga America across the Atlantic. Having an actual industrial-scale production line in the CQP will allow us to shorten the time it will take to reach targeted yield and uptime in our subsequent gigafactories.

POWER: How does your technology differ from other battery manufacturers?

Jensen: We have chosen a U.S. technology licensing partner in the MIT-spinoff 24M Technologies Inc. The start of operations at the CQP will inaugurate the global launch of one industrial-scale production line of the 24M SemiSolid production platform at GWh scale. The battery cell design itself is improved through providing substantially larger and thicker electrodes, which implies that we have fewer repeating layers in the cell and therefore increase the amount of energy-carrying material per battery cell, lowering the bill of material costs per KWh. The larger physical structure also provides for significant system-level cost savings as we need fewer modules, packs and Battery Management System-related costs at the final product/system level.

The production process is also dramatically simplified and fundamentally improved, and we project that the technology enables substantially lower capex, lower energy consumption, less space, and up to three times as many batteries produced per employee when produced at GWh scale.

POWER: How does the Georgia manufacturing plant support your position among global battery manufacturers?

Jensen: FREYR has created real option value with parallel project development in Norway and the U.S. catalyzed by CQP and [the] IRA. We are evaluating multiple options to fast-track the start of production at Giga America, targeting start-up in 2025. We are considering different roadmaps that will give us a shorter time to market and competitive products, to capture IRA benefits and the growing ESS [energy storage system] opportunity. Our customers value that we can provide products from multiple geographies. The U.S. is also the fastest-growing ESS market in the world, which is a market segment we have a core focus on.

POWER: Can you provide details about the engineering behind the 24M technology?

Jensen: The SemiSolid platform is a significantly simpler production process, reducing the number of production process steps in half. In short, this technology produces larger and thicker electrodes, which implies producing final battery products that are much more adapted to the end products it is now being used for such as vehicles and energy storage containers. The fundamental change in the technology is that the electrolyte is used as the binder and solvent upfront in the production process, eliminating the need for expensive and space-consuming solvent recovery and drying process steps.

POWER: How are you able to reduce production costs while delivering higher energy density per volumetric unit?

Jensen: 24M’s SemiSolid production platform produces products that are fit for the purpose batteries are now being used for, and it will offer superior cost and performance when produced at GWh scale. With a simplified production process, we project to reduce capex per installed GWh unit significantly, reduce the energy consumption, and triple productivity per employee through further automation and digitalization. At the final product level we also see that the physically larger products could reduce total costs significantly by reducing the number of repeating structures at the system level.

POWER: Is your group challenged by supply chain issues? If so, why, and if not, how are you able to avoid them?

Jensen: Our general strategy is to develop a network of global suppliers, but we are targeting regional and decarbonized supply chains. We want to minimize the logistics chains to make it as cost-efficient and carbon-efficient as possible, but at the same time maintain the global flexibility to be resilient. This means that a major share of the raw materials we need in Europe will be supplied from Europe, and for U.S. from North America, but there will of course be some cross-continental supply, also including Asia. We have so far been able to secure all raw materials we need, and a major part of the volatility in the underlying raw material costs is covered through pass-through mechanisms in our offtake contracts.

POWER: What are the biggest issues today for the global battery manufacturing market?

Jensen: FREYR is moving as fast as we can to decarbonize energy and transportation systems globally. This is a growing industry as demand is increasing fast, and to be able to produce all the batteries needed, there will be a need for more of everything. To be able to meet demand, the world will need to install seven times more battery capacity in the next seven years if we are going to stay within the reasonable climate boundaries. The main challenge thus facing the battery industry is to be able to scale up fast, which requires huge amounts of capital and competence in record-breaking time to ensure high-quality products with impeccable safety and sustainability standards.
