Manufacturing,2023-06-19 13:59:38+00:00,"At Northvolt, weâre developing a sustainable manufacturing base for an industrial revolution that defines humanityâs greatest challenge â eliminating its dependance on fossil fuels.

All under one roof

Weâre re-writing the playbook on what it means to be a battery manufacturer by adopting a wide spectrum of battery supply chain activities in-house.

With this vertically integrated approach weâre aiming to produce the most sustainable batteries in the world.

Beyond manufacturing, weâve invested deeply into software and digital competences. And weâre deploying these throughout our activities to build better, smarter, cleaner battery solutions.",https://northvolt.com/manufacturing/
Northvolt Ett,2023-07-04 00:00:00,"At the Bergsbyn industrial area in Skellefteå, Northvolt Ett is being built. This is where Northvolt will have most of its production. The factory will be one of Europe's largest battery factories, producing the world's greenest lithium-ion batteries for electric cars and energy storage. The area is as large as 71 football fields and Northvolt's establishment will generate about 4,000 jobs in Skellefteå when the factory is fully completed in 2026.

The construction started in 2018 and is divided into stages. The first stage included four production buildings that were completed at the end of 2021.

When the entire Northvolt Ett is in operation, the factory will be able to deliver batteries equivalent to 60-gigawatt hours per year, which is enough to manufacture about one million electric cars.

Between 2021 and 2022 new roads have been built adjacent to the area to create better traffic flows. An extension of Torsgatan from Northvolt to road 372 has been constructed, as well as a new roundabout from road 372 to the entrance of the area.

To ensure that employees feel safe cycling or walking to work, a new pedestrian and cycle path has been built. It runs parallel to Torsgatan and was completed in early 2023.

On site you can also find Revolt Ett, Europe's only large-scale recycling factory. It has he capacity to recycle materials needed for battery production and is the key to creating the world's greenest batteries.

Northvolt starts delivering cells from Skellefteå factory,2022-05-18 00:00:00,"Northvolt has started commercial deliveries of battery cells to a car manufacturer. It makes the Swedish start-up the first European firm that has managed to do so. And, they have made the shipments from the Ett factory in Skellefteå, Sweden, on schedule.

Production has only been running for a few months. Northvolt’s first battery cell factory in Sweden that is now delivering made the first cell in December as reported. Already then, the company was confident, naming the date as “a new chapter in European industrial history” as it would be the first battery cell “designed, developed and assembled entirely in a Gigafactory by a domestic European battery company”. Having managed that, production is expected to increase further this year.

The Northvolt Ett factory currently employs about 1,000 people, a company spokesperson told Bloomberg, prompting the news agency to add that Northvolt continues hiring about 150 new employees each month. The company expects the number of employees in North Sweden to rise to around 4,000 in the long term, up from an earlier estimate of 3,000.

The report made no mention of who Northvolt supplied with the first cells. However, their push answers a dire need across the European car industry. The company, founded by ex-Tesla VP for Supply chain, Peter Carlsson, has signed contracts with carmakers worth more than $50 billion so far, and Bloomberg suggests this may help the newcomers survive skyrocketing prices for raw materials. Among Northvolt’s customers are BMW, Volkswagen, Volvo Cars and Polestar. The cooperation with Volkswagen will for example see the factory in Skellefteå deliver the new “standard” cells to the Group. Previous plans to run a factory in Salzgitter together have been scrapped.

In addition, Northvolt recently received a grant of 155 million for its planned battery plant in Germany. Northvolt Three will be built in the town of Heide, close to the border of Denmark, and is to go into operation in 2025, employing up to 3,000 people. According to Northvolt, the envisioned 60 GWh capacity will be enough for around one million electric vehicles. The Northvolt Drei plant increases Northvolt’s total production capacity to 170 GWh.

The company also announced another cell factory in Sweden, not far from Volvo’s Torslanda plant, in partnership with Volvo Cars this April. This will be Northvolt’s third battery factory in Sweden. The company is refurbishing an old paper mill in Borlänge into a gigafactory to produce up to 100 GWh of cathode material as well as battery cells.

A few days ago, Hydrovolt, Northvolt’s joint venture with Norsk Hydro, also commissioned its battery recycling plant in Fredrikstad, Norway.

North Swedish battery gigafactory expands before production start,,"The gigafactory outside Skellefteå in northern Sweden has not yet started production before funding to a 50% expansion of capacity is on the table. Northvolt, branding its factory to produce World’s greenest battery, will start output later this year, with customers like VW, BMW, and Scania hungry to buy whatever the production lines can provide.

Between 2019 and 2027, the size of the global market for electric vehicles (EV) is expected to boom almost five-fold. This year, more than 4 million battery-powered cars will be sold, with an accumulated number by 2027 believed to reach more than 230 million units.

Limited production of batteries is one factor that could be limiting the size of the market.

As recently reported by the Barents Observer, northern Sweden takes a lead position in the new industrial revolution, shifting to technologies aimed to slow climate change. The regions of Västerbotten and Norrbotten alone are expected to get 10,000 new workplaces with carbon-free production of steel, mining of metals, and battery production.

Northvolt’s factory in Skellefteå alone will count for 6,000 employees. All production will be based on renewable energy like hydropower, windmills and solar.

The $2,75 billion raised in new equity comes from the Swedish pension funds, OMERS Capital Market alongside existing investors in Northvolt like Goldman Sachs and VW Group, the company says in a press statement.

VW is one of Northvolt’s main customers and has already ordered batteries for $14 billion to supply the group’s wide range of electric vehicles from Audi, Skoda, Seat, Porsche and VW.

Northern Scandinavia is a small, but leading market in transition to carbon-free transport. In Norway, EV’s share of the private car market reached 60% in May, and several cities in northern Sweden are seriously investing in battery-powered public transport.

In total, Northvolt has now raised more than $6,5bn in equity and debt.

“We have a solid base of world-class investors and customers on-board who share Northvolt’s mission of building the world’s greenest battery to enable the European transition to renewable energy,” says Peter Carlsson, CEO and Co-Founder of Northvolt.

CFO of Northvolt, Alexander Hartman, said: “This is a new European industry in the making and it will require significant investments over the coming decade. It is encouraging to see that the investor community has identified the opportunity early, and we hope to see more investments throughout the value chain over the coming years.”",https://thebarentsobserver.com/en/industry-and-energy/2021/06/north-swedish-battery-gigafactory-expands-production-start
