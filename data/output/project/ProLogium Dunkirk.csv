ProLogium picks northern France for new battery gigafactory - sources,2023-05-09 00:00:00,"PARIS, May 9 (Reuters) - Taiwanese company ProLogium will build a battery ""gigafactory"" in Dunkirk, northern France, two sources said on Tuesday, as European countries and carmakers seek to lure suppliers of key components for electric vehicles onto their home turf.

The plant, making solid-state batteries, will be ProLogium's biggest and its second one in the world - the other being in Taiwan. French President Emmanuel Macron is set to travel to Dunkirk on Friday and make a formal announcement, business daily Les Echos reported earlier.

One of the sources said the new factory - the fourth battery plant to be based in the north of France - would involve an investment of 5.2 billion euros ($5.7 billion) through to 2030.

""It's a big bet for our region and we are winning it, with four plants opening starting from 2024,"" said the second source, close to the Hauts-de-France region around Dunkirk.

""The idea is to create an ecosystem here, from the production to the recycling of batteries,"" this source said, adding the ProLogium plant was expected to create 3,000 jobs over time.

Macron's office declined to comment.

Carmakers globally are racing to keep ahead of rivals in producing cleaner vehicles, secure greater control over their supply chain and bring battery plants - an industry dominated by Asian companies - closer to their own manufacturing sites.

Renault (RENA.PA) last month said it had entered a long-term commercial partnership with French start-up Verkor in Dunkirk to produce batteries for the carmaker's premium and Alpine electric models.

Also in the north of France, China's Envision AESC and ACC - a subsidiary of Renault's domestic rival Stellantis (STLAM.MI), TotalEnergies (TTEF.PA) and Mercedes (MBGn.DE) - plan to establish their respective battery plants.

The three plants already announced are expected to help create 5,500 jobs.

ProLogium Announces €5.2b Gigafactory in Dunkirk France and Greets French President Emmanuel Macron,2023-05-13 15:00:58+00:00,"Specifically, ProLogium’s objective is threefold: to put down roots in Europe, to mass-produce next-generation batteries for electric vehicles (EVs), and to support the energy transition of the EU automotive industry, as ICE car sale will be banned by 2035. ProLogium will invest a total of €5.2 billion to set up a 48 GWh gigafactory and an R&D center, strategically located in Europe. The localization of advanced battery manufacturing will also be a significant milestone in French government’s green reindustrialization strategy.

Founded in 2006, ProLogium has demonstrated its ability to produce solid-state battery (SSB) on a large scale. Its automated pilot production line was activated in 2017, and since then ProLogium has mastered the key to solid-state battery commercialization, with years of experience in various consumer and industrial electronics applications. Its proprietary technologies are protected by over 600 patents worldwide. With the gigafactory in Dunkirk, ProLogium will provide the European automotive industry state-of-the-art battery solutions produced with decarbonized energy. ProLogium next-generation batteries will enable better performance for EVs and will help drive the energy transition of the sector.

Safer, greener, lighter batteries that charge faster

The technology developed by ProLogium may provide an answer to limitations faced by current EVs as it demonstrates better safety, durability, and faster-charge capability, all of which contribute to elevated user experience for EV drivers.

ProLogium replaces the fragile and flammable separator and liquid electrolyte in current LIBs with robust ceramic separator and uninflammable solid-state electrolyte. With improved safety, ProLogium’s solid-state battery allows for the use of highly active cathode and anode materials, thus enabling higher energy density, which means longer range for EV drivers. Solid-state battery can also reduce the time for EV recharge to a level similar to the time it takes to refuel an ICE car.

ProLogium is also dedicated to making batteries for a greener future. Leveraging the proprietary solid structure and stable chemical properties of its solid-state electrolyte, ProLogium developed the patented “original-phase recycling” technology, a streamlined process to recycle a higher proportion of solid-state electrolyte with lower energy consumption. From recovery to reuse, the entire recycling process will help build up a sustainable circular economy for the local battery industry.

Moreover, the use of decarbonized electricity for manufacturing processes will further reduce the carbon footprint of EVs with ProLogium battery inside.

ProLogium gigafactory in Dunkirk will yield positive economic benefits for the territory

The city of Dunkirk was selected from a long list of over 90 cities in Europe following a rigorous review process for its well-established infrastructure and superb geographic assets, this region will allow ProLogium to benefit from a supply of stable and low-carbon electricity at a competitive price, thanks to various sources of decarbonized electricity that are or will soon be present in Dunkirk, first and foremost the EDF power plant in Gravelines, but also the future offshore wind farm and a photovoltaic plant. This project will be located in the port of Dunkirk, close to Northern European automotive manufacturing plants and the international shipping network. These features make Dunkirk an ideal location to realize ProLogium’s vision of implementing local supply and local manufacturing for European OEM customers.

Located at the heart of Northern France’s “Battery Valley”, the ProLogium gigafactory site will also enjoy the advantages afforded by a thriving battery ecosystem supported by robust research capabilities.

ProLogium’s project is expected to create 3,000 direct jobs and 12,000 indirect jobs for the local Dunkirk community by 2030. Scheduled to start production by the end of 2026, the construction is set to begin in the second half of 2024 once the public concertation, under the supervision of the CNDP, and permitting process are complete. ProLogium also plans to establish an R&D center in France as part of its localization efforts.

“We were competing with the entire world and you chose France and Dunkirk. You trust in a country and an industrial site over the long term, and so we will be committed to meet the deadlines, the financing and everything that will enable you to succeed over the long term.” said French President Emmanuel Macron. “Thank you, well done and keep it up. You can be proud of what you have done.”

“Today is a special day for our company as we announce our major commitment in Europe, and particularly in France. We would like to express our sincere appreciation to France and the people of Dunkirk for welcoming us to the community,” remarked Vincent Yang, Founder and CEO of ProLogium.

“We are thrilled by the opportunity to set up our base in Dunkirk, a perfect location for us to localize our value chain and be close to our customers and markets. With steadfast backing from the French government and our partners from the battery value chain in Europe, we want to contribute to the development of the battery valley in Northern France and accelerate the transition to clean transportation with solid-state battery industrialization. This is in line with our vision and mission to drive the wide adoption of e-mobility and create a better and cleaner world for the generations to come.”

Gilles Normand, ProLogium Executive Vice President International Development, commented “Selecting an ideal location in Europe has been an intense year-long process. Over 90 potential sites across 13 countries were reviewed. The final choice has been difficult with 3 formidable final contenders. We are pleased to put our roots down in Dunkirk, France after comprehensive evaluation. We have felt a strong sense of support at every level of the French Government in the process led by Business France and the Minister of Economy, Finances and Industrial & Digital Sovereignty. We would like to express our special thanks to the Region Hauts de France, the Communauté Urbaine de Dunkerque and the Grand Port Maritime de Dunkerque for their continuous support, which has exceeded our expectations in more ways than one. Today marks the completion of the first phase of our project. Moving forward, it’s time to work with all stakeholders and the people of Dunkirk to make our vision of carbon neutrality a reality.”
