FREYR Battery Provides Operations Update,,"FREYR achieves important interim milestone by successfully conducting automated cathode casting trials

FREYR Battery (NYSE: FREY) (“FREYR” or the “Company”), a developer of clean, next-generation battery cell production capacity, has provided an update this morning on the company’s operational progress at the Customer Qualification Plant (“CQP”) in Mo i Rana, Norway.

Successful automated cathode casting trials

Following successful adjustments to the cathode casting equipment that included updates to the vacuum system, last week, FREYR’s teams at the CQP commenced automated cathode casting runs at a minimum nozzle distance of 0.26 mm.

The CQP teams have subsequently conducted successful cathode casting runs using the cathode web and solvent slurry at fixed nozzle distances of 0.5 mm and 1.0 mm, respectively, and at speeds of 2 meters per minute while using 100 psi of casting pressure. These successful automated cathode casting runs with solvent slurry were an important precursor to completing the Casting and Unit Cell Assembly commissioning packages and the eventual start of automated CQP production.

“I am very pleased to share that our teams at the CQP have reached another important interim technical milestone,” commented Mike Brose, FREYR’s Head of the Asset Mo team. “In doing so, our people and partners have demonstrated their collective ability to systematically link small but critical steps together to achieve the required outcome. We are able to integrate this vital part of the SemiSolidTM technology platform only because of the many milestones already completed together over the last several months by the FREYR Asset Mo team, our coworkers around the world, and our valued partners and suppliers. As we look forward to 2024, FREYR’s top priority is to finalize commissioning at the CQP and to begin automated production of in-spec, customer-testable batteries. With this latest milestone behind us, we will continue to apply unwavering focus to the remaining tasks that are necessary to achieve that goal.”

CQP commissioning status and key next steps

Following the successful automated cathode casting trials, FREYR has completed handovers of 342 (88%) of the 388 discrete production line equipment commissioning and testing packages at the CQP. The test center packages and handovers to operations are all complete.

The next technical requirements to stay on track with FREYR’s anticipated completion cadence at the CQP are:

Replicate the successful automated cathode casting trials with the anode production line system; and

Integrate the casting webs across the cathode, anode, and merge units of the Casting and Unit Cell Assembly equipment using the highly complex Multi-Carrier Systems (“MCS”) to reach automated cell production.

FREYR drives development and production of…,,"FREYR drives development and production of next-generation battery cell technology

FREYR Battery is ramping up production at the Customer Qualification Plant (CQP) in Mo i Rana, Norway, taking the U.S. technology from 24M Technologies to GWh scale.

Back in November 2020, FREYR selected 24M as technology partner for lithium-ion cell manufacturing with their SemiSolidTM platform. The MIT-spinoff founded by Dr. Yet-Ming Chiang is already commercially introduced at MWh-scale in Asia, which was a key aspect in the selection process.

- The 24M technology is fundamentally improving and simplifying the production process compared to conventional Li-ion battery cells. We expect lower costs, lower energy consumption, and increased capacity per employee, says Dr. Andreas Bentzen, EVP Technology in FREYR, who has with close to 20 years of experience from the solar industry, including REC Group in Silicon Valley and Otovo which he also Co-Founded.

– The products we develop and put in production at the CQP will be inherently safer and more reliable, offer easier waste recovery and end-of-life recycling, as well as consuming less inactive materials.

Simplified manufacturing processes

FREYR is using a SemiSolidTM platform, where that the anode and cathode slurry has a clay-like composition much thicker than conventional Li-ion production, avoiding the needs for solvent evaporation and recovery. The number of unique process steps are significantly reduced, and the usage of inactive materials is much lower.

- Manufacturing Li-ion battery cells is a fast-moving production process with a high degree of automation and digitalization. We are using advanced technologies to drive accelerated learning in both our development and manufacturing processes, improving performance, and reducing waste, says Bentzen.

The simplified manufacturing process results in next-generation battery cells with several competitive advantages:",https://www.freyrbattery.com/news/freyr-drives-development-and-production-of-next-generation-battery-cell-technology

FREYR Battery concludes frame agreements for…,,"FREYR Battery concludes frame agreements for more than 90% of its raw material requirements for initial plants in Mo i Rana

New York, Oslo and Luxembourg, February 2, 2022, FREYR Battery (“FREYR”), a developer of clean, next-generation battery cell production capacity, has entered into nine frame agreements with key suppliers for the supply of battery materials required for the Customer Qualification Plant (“CQP”) being built in Mo i Rana, Norway. The remaining four frame agreements are in the final stages of negotiations. These frame agreements will be the basis for supply of raw materials to the CQP as well as to Gigafactories 1 and 2.

FREYR is on track to start the initial sample production of lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery cells in its CQP in the second half of 2022. The frame agreements described above will form the legal basis for the supply of the facility with cathode active material, anode active material, separators, electrolyte, Al-foil, Cu-foil, and insulation material, comprising more than 90% of the material required on both a value and volume basis. The next step will be to agree on volume and price for each raw material, after which FREYR will be in a position to issue purchase orders.

“We are very pleased to announce that we have made strong progress in establishing a framework that would allow us to secure a large part of the critical raw materials required for our initial production facilities,” said Dr. Tilo Hauke, EVP of Supply Chain in FREYR. “In an increasingly market short environment both for battery cells and raw materials, a core strategic focus for the company is to secure its supply chain,” he added.

FREYR has also entered into an agreement for localized supply of raw materials in the Nordics with Glencore, as well as a Heads of Terms for a JV with the Taiwanese company Aleees to establish giga production of LFP cathode materials in the region. This JV is expected to address the need to establish competitive European LFP cathode supply, which is currently primarily sourced from major producers in China. Both agreements demonstrate FREYR’s progress in delivering the supply of localized, low-carbon raw materials for Gigafactory battery-cell production in Norway and Finland.

FREYR has a stated ambition of sourcing all its raw materials locally to its Gigafactories in the Nordics and in the USA and base such supply on renewable energy sources. Localized raw material production based on renewable energy is a core part of enabling FREYR’s delivery of world-class battery solutions with the lowest possible carbon footprint.

“FREYR is targeting an 80% reduction in CO 2 e emissions on a full life cycle basis including logistics and recycling, documented through relevant Life Cycle Assessments (LCA). Enabling a localized supply chain for raw materials comprises close to half of this ambition and could add up to 31 kg CO 2 e saved per KWh of battery produced on top of the 33 kg CO 2 e saved per KWh by producing, packaging, and recycling battery cells in Norway and/or the Nordic region,” said Tom Einar Jensen, CEO and Co-Founder of FREYR Battery.

“At current (ETS) prices per ton of CO 2 e in the EU, which recently broke through 100 US$/t, these CO 2 e savings comprise a potential value of 6.3 US$/KWh of battery cell produced. Based on FREYR’s currently targeted production of 83 GWh in 2028 this translates to more than $500 million in yearly ‘de-carbonization value,” Jensen concluded.

FREYR is now actively working on documenting and validating the LCA aspects of the company’s ambitions and progress and how such value can accrue to the company and its partners.

About FREYR Battery

FREYR Battery aims to provide industrial scale clean battery solutions to reduce global emissions. Listed on the New York Stock Exchange, FREYR’s mission is to produce green battery cells to accelerate the decarbonization of energy and transportation systems globally.
