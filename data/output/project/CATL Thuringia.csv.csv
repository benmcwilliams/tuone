CATL Unveils Its Latest Breakthrough Technology by Releasing Its First Generation of Sodium-ion Batteries,,"Breaking through the bottleneck of sodium-ion battery technology

As carbon neutrality has become a global consensus, the new energy industry has entered a complex and diversified development stage. The increasingly segmented markets have raised differentiated requirements for batteries. At the same time, the worldwide research and development of basic materials for batteries is accelerating, which opens a two-way window for the industrialization of sodium-ion batteries.

The sodium-ion battery has a similar working principle to the lithium-ion battery. Sodium ions also shuttle between the cathode and anode. However, compared with lithium ions, sodium ions have a larger volume and higher requirements regarding structural stability and the kinetic properties of materials. This has become a bottleneck for the industrialization of sodium-ion batteries.

CATL has been dedicated to the research and development of sodium-ion battery electrode materials for many years. In terms of cathode materials, CATL has applied Prussian white material with a higher specific capacity and redesigned the bulk structure of the material by rearranging the electrons, which solved the worldwide problem of rapid capacity fading upon material cycling. In terms of anode materials, CATL has developed a hard carbon material that features a unique porous structure, which enables the abundant storage and fast movement of sodium ions, and also an outstanding cycle performance.

Based on a series of innovations in the chemistry system, CATL's first generation of sodium-ion batteries has the advantages of high-energy density, fast-charging capability, excellent thermal stability, great low-temperature performance and high-integration efficiency, among others. The energy density of CATL's sodium-ion battery cell can achieve up to 160Wh/kg, and the battery can charge in 15 minutes to 80% SOC at room temperature. Moreover, in a low- temperature environment of -20Â°C, the sodium-ion battery has a capacity retention rate of more than 90%, and its system integration efficiency can reach more than 80%. The sodium-ion batteries' thermal stability exceeds the national safety requirements for traction batteries. The first generation of sodium-ion batteries can be used in various transportation electrification scenarios, especially in regions with extremely low temperatures, where its outstanding advantages become obvious. Also, it can be flexibly adapted to the application needs of all scenarios in the energy storage field.

Four-pillar innovation system in support of three strategic development directions

CATL has always been committed to being a global premier innovative technology corporation and delivering excellent contributions to the green energy resolution for mankind as its vision. To achieve its vision, CATL is making unremitting efforts in three strategic development directions. The first development direction is to replace stationary fossil energy with renewable energy generation and energy storage; the second is to replace mobile fossil energy by using EV batteries to accelerate the development of E-mobility; the third is to promote the integration innovation of market applications leveraging electrification plus intelligence to accelerate the drive towards new energy applications in different fields. To support sustainable development in these three development directions, CATL has established a four-pillar innovation system, namely in the chemistry system, structure system, manufacturing system and business models, to build a rapid transformation capability from fundamental research to industrial application, and then to large-scale commercialization.

The fundamental research of material and the chemistry system is of great importance. Dr. Robin Zeng, chairman of CATL, has said that some people believe that the battery chemistry system will hardly see any more breakthroughs, and that only improvements can be made in the physical structure system. But we believe that the world of electrochemistry is like the Energy Cube, where there are still a lot of unknowns for us to discover. We never get tired of exploring its mysteries. By using a high-throughput calculation platform and simulation technology, based on our deep understanding of principles combined with the application of advanced algorithms and computing capacity, we engage in an in-depth exploration to develop a chemistry system that is most suitable for sodium-ion batteries, enable them to enter the fast track to industrialization, and continuously evolve. The next generation of sodium-ion batteries' energy density development target is to exceed 200Wh/kg.

In terms of battery system innovation, CATL has made another breakthrough in battery system integration and developed an AB battery system solution, which is to mix and match sodium-ion batteries and lithium-ion batteries in a certain proportion and integrate them into one battery system, and control the different battery systems through the BMS precision algorithm. The AB battery system solution can compensate for the current energy-density shortage of the sodium-ion battery, and also expand its advantages of high power and performance in low temperatures. Thanks to this innovative structure system, application scenarios for the lithium-sodium battery system are expanded.

Multi-dimensional deployment to promote the industrialization of sodium-ion batteries

At the event, Dr. Qisen Huang, deputy dean of the CATL Research Institute, said that sodium-ion battery manufacturing is perfectly compatible with the lithium-ion battery production equipment and processes, and the production lines can be rapidly switched to achieve a high-production capacity. As of now, CATL has started its industrial deployment of sodium-ion batteries, and plans to form a basic industrial chain by 2023. CATL invites upstream suppliers and downstream customers, as well as research institutions to jointly accelerate the promotion and development of sodium-ion batteries.

Dr. Robin Zeng said that carbon neutrality has spawned a demand for TWh-scale batteries and has promoted the vigorous development of the new energy industry. The continued emergence of application demands has given an opportunity to showcase the capabilities of different technologies. Diversified technical routes will also assure the stability of the industry's long-term development.

CATL launches cell production in new 60 GWh factory,2021-12-22,"The Chinese battery cell manufacturer CATL has started production at its largest plant to date in Fuding near Ningde in Fujian province, which is to offer an annual capacity of 120 GWh when completed. The first phase, which has now started, is said to have a capacity of 60 GWh per year.

The Fuding plant is CATLâs largest single project to date. To illustrate the scale: This battery factory alone has a planned capacity almost equal to the total installed capacity of all battery cell manufacturers in China in the first eleven months of 2021 â which was 128.3 GWh. According to current battery prices, 120 GWh would have a production value of over 100 billion yuan, or just under 14 billion euros.

CATL had announced a new plant in Ningde in February 2020, which it said at the time would be completed within two years. The planned production capacity of the plant, which will cost up to 10 billion yuan (about 1.3 billion euros at the time), was not mentioned in 2020.

However, construction did not start until this year, Liu Henghua, operational manager of the project, said, according to a report in the Fujian Daily. âWith the support of government departments at all levels, Fuding CATL took about 330 days from the piling of the plant to the commissioning of the first production line, achieving the start of construction to commissioning in the same year,â Liu said.

It is not clear from the reports how quickly full utilisation of the 60 GWh of the first phase will be achieved. According to the report, the first phase will include four cell plants, three module assemblies and âsupporting facilitiesâ such as warehouses and dormitories. The plant is expected to create a total of about 10,000 jobs.

In addition, on 19 December, CATL broke ground for the construction of another production facility in Xiamen in Fujian Province, which is to be completed in December 2024 with a capacity of around 20 GWh.

The company â like virtually all cell manufacturers â is on a huge expansion course. According to figures from the China Automotive Battery Innovation Alliance (CABIA), CATL had an installed production capacity of 11.45 GWh in China in November, giving it a market share of 55 per cent. However, the company has already announced its own plants and production facilities of joint ventures with carmakers, which add up to 600 GWh.

CATL: Staying on top of the battery game,2023-12-01,"Last year, CATL produced 37% of the worldâs EV batteries and 43.4% of energy storage batteries for a grand total of 289 GWh and 2023 is shaping to be another landmark year.

According to South Korean research firm SNE Research, CATL cemented its domination of the global EV industry in the January-August period this year with 37% market share, followed by second-ranked BYD with 16%. Its sales outside of China reached 27.7%, up by 6.9% year-on-year.

As pv magazine learned from CATL, in the third quarter of 2023, the companyâs battery sales volume stood at around 100 GWh, with BESS accounting for nearly 20%.

According to CATL, innovation is the key driver of its growth. In the first three quarters of 2023, CATL invested about 14.88 billion yuan ($2.1 billion) in R&D.

As of the first half of 2023, CATLâs issued and pending patents have reached 22,039 worldwide, and it has contributed to the drafting or amending of over 110 industry standards at home and abroad.

With R&D centers in Ningde, Liyang, Shanghai, Xiamen and Munich, which employ more than 17,998, CATL is managing to stay at the forefront of development in energy storage technologies.

Some of its key breakthroughs include the development of liquid-cooling energy storage solutions with long service life and high level of safety.

pv magazine roundtables Europe 2023 Session 8 | Dec 6, 10:30 am CET, virtual | All about storage: Price, materials, tech, and new revenue As the energy storage sector continues to grow and mature, understanding costs and revenue opportunities is the highest priority for many stakeholders.

As CATL underlines, âensuring the safety of energy storage batteries poses far greater challenges than those for EV batteries, as it requires a much higher level of consistency in manufacturing as well as innovation in cell and system design.â

By deploying advanced technologies including 5G, flexible automation and IoT, CATL has achieved a defect rate of DPPB (single defect rate per billion) for its cells, which is the top in the industry.

As for the next frontier in development of lithium-iron-phosphate (LFP) batteries, today's leading energy storage technology, CATLâs goal is further optimization of product performance including service life, power rating, and direct current resistance (DCR), which will in return pave the way to more competitive batteries for its customers.

In terms of cycle life, CATL has already made and deployed batteries capable of cycling 12,000 times. In 2020, CATL deployed the 12,000-cycle ultra-long-life batteries at the Jinjiang 100 MWh Energy Storage Power Station, which has been operating safely ever since, according to the company. CATLâs stated goal is to increase the cycle life to 18,000 cycles.

Beyond lithium-ion stationary storage technology, CATL is also at the forefront of development of the sodium-ion chemistry. It sees the technology as compatible and complementary to lithium-ion batteries.

CATL says it has successfully built the basic industry chain for sodium-ion batteries and established the mass production capacity, noting that the production volume and shipment scale depend on the implementation of customersâ projects.

According to CATL, there are still many conditions that need to be met in the market before the large-scale commercial application of sodium-ion technology. âWe hope that the whole industry will work together to promote the development of sodium-ion batteries,â company representatives say.

In 2021, CATL rolled out its first generation sodium-ion battery with an energy density of 160 Wh/kg and promised an increase to 200 Wh/kg for the next generation. In April, it confirmed that Chinese Chery will become the first automaker to use its sodium-ion battery tech.

This year, CATL has also signalled that it is setting a foot into the emerging field of long-duration energy storage. In November, the manufacturer announced a 10 GWh supply deal inked with Australian renewable energy investor Quinbrook, which will initially involve the delivery of 1 GWh of CATLâs latest outdoor container LFP solution called EnerC Plus.

It also said that the partners will work closely together to assess the viability of âCATL's groundbreaking 8hr charge and 16hr discharge energy storage solutionâ for use on the Sun Cable Project located in Australia's Northern Territory, which is expected to include up to 20 GW of solar and up to 42 GWh of battery storage.

In the EV sphere, CATLâs major announcement this year was the development of the âcondensed matterâ battery, a type of semi-solid state product with condensed electrolyte and new anode and separator materials, will have an energy density of up to 500 Wh/kg.

This was preceeded by the launch of Qilin battery in 2022, the third generation of its cell-to-pack technology, claiming the highest integration level to date. With a record-breaking volume utilization efficiency of 72% and an energy density of up to 255 Wh/kg, Qilin is capable of delivering a range of over 1,000 km and equating to a five-minute hot start and ten minutes of charging to get from 10-80% state of charge.",https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/12/01/catl-staying-on-top-of-the-battery-game/
CATL takes off â Europeâs largest cell production facility starts production,2023-05-05,"Thuringia is home to one of the largest investments of this kind in Europe and marked a major milestone at the beginning of the year: Chinese global market leader Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Ltd. (CATL) is building its first battery cell manufacturing facility outside of China in the industry park âErfurter Kreuzâ and officially launched its local production of lithium-ion cells at the end of January. CATL is investing around EUR 2 billion in what is currently Europeâs largest cell production facility; up to 2,000 jobs will be created.

After delays caused by Corona, production was set up according to plan: Production initially started on two module lines, and by the end of 2023 the planned six lines are scheduled to go into operation, generating an output of 24 GWh/a. In the meantime, the number of employees has grown to around 1,000. Thuringia's Minister President Bodo Ramelow, Economics Minister Tiefensee, Environment Minister Anja Siegesmund and representatives of LEG ThÃ¼ringen, who have intensively accompanied this investment, took part in the inauguration ceremony. At the site south of the Thuringian capital of Erfurt, the company focuses not only on manufacturing but also on research and development and in the nearby Erfurt cargo hub the CATL European logistics headquarters are established. Thuringia is fast evolving into one of Europeâs most innovative regions for the future of mobility, especially electric vehicles. For example, the state recently funded the establishment of the new Battery Innovation and Technology Center (BITC), which is already partnering with CATL.

CATL reportedly vetting sites for US battery production to support BMW and Ford,2022-05-06,"A recent report states that global battery conglomerate CATL is in the final stages of vetting potential sites to bring EV battery production to the US. The move would mark the companyâs first entry into the second largest automotive market in the world, and the new facilities would provide cells to BMW AG and Ford Motor Company for their EV production stateside.

Contemporary Amperex Technology Co Ltd., better known as CATL, is a global energy technology company and the leading EV battery manufacturer in China. Beyond Asia, the company has retained its crown as the worldâs largest battery manufacturer by installed capacity for a fifth-straight year.

In addition to recent projects to implement battery recycling and net-zero carbon manufacturing facilities in China, CATL has begun to expand outside of its home country. Its first announcement came this past April with plans for an 8 GWh battery plant in Germany.

A week later, CATL announced a $6 billion investment to mine, manufacture, and recycle batteries in Indonesia, expanding its global reach further. According to the latest report, CATL plans to soon be manufacturing EV batteries in the US as well, and could be providing cells to US automakers assembling nearby.

Could CATL be making batteries in the US for Ford and BMW?

According to a report from Reuters, sources close to the matter say CATL is in the final stages of determining potential sites to set up US manufacturing. Two possible locations include South Carolina and Kentucky, where BMW AG and Ford Motor Company currently have assembly plants.

According to sources who asked not to be identified, talks are ongoing, but CATL would provide battery cells to both BMW and Ford from facilities erected near their respective assembly plants. One source elaborated, stating that CATL is looking to commence battery production for BMW in South Carolina by 2026.

In a statement, current CATL customer BMW shared it is âintensively examining the possibility of establishing a battery factoryâ in the US, as well as acquiring battery materials stateside. The company also said it is in talks with several partners regarding the factory.

Last September, Ford announced a massive EV production project called Blue Oval City in Tennessee, which included a battery plant with the help of SK Innovation. Additionally, the two parties shared plans for a second plant near Fordâs assembly facilities in Louisville, Kentucky.

With electric truck demand beginning to soar for the American automaker, additional battery cells in Tennessee or Louisville make sense. Considering Tennessee is where the electrified trucks are currently planned to be produced, a CATL plant feels like a better fit.

However, that isnât to say Ford wonât refurbish its Kentucky plants currently assembling ICE vehicles like the Escape, Expedition, and F Series to support EVs, too, especially since itâs already building a battery plant there with SK. Ford declined to comment.

CATLâs expedited expansion to the US comes at an opportune time, following the Department Energyâs recent $3 billion program to support local battery manufacturing â part of the Biden administrationâs larger $7.5 billion infrastructure bill approved last year.

CATL has declined to comment so far.",https://electrek.co/2022/05/06/catl-reportedly-vetting-sites-for-us-battery-production-to-support-bmw-and-ford/
CATL to build new battery making projects with up to $3.8 billion investment,2021-12-30,"This is the seventh to tenth phase of CATL's Yibin manufacturing base, with a planned site area of approximately 2.13 million square meters.

Contemporary Amperex Technology Co Ltd (CATL), the power battery supplier to Tesla and NIO, announced today that it will invest up to RMB 24 billion ($3.8 billion) in power battery manufacturing projects in Yibin, Sichuan province.

A Hungarian Town Seethes Over a Giant Chinese Battery Plant,2023-03-15,"The small-town mayor, long a loyal foot soldier for Hungaryâs governing party, recently committed what he described as âpolitical suicide,â throwing himself in the path of an enormous $7.8 billion Chinese battery factory project promoted by his dissent-intolerant prime minister, Viktor Orban.

âIt is like lying in front of a steamroller,â Zoltan Timar, the mayor of Mikepercs, said of his decision to side with residents opposed to the project, which his Fidesz party championed. âI just hope it wonât roll over me too soon.â

The factory, which would be the biggest of its kind in Europe, is the fruit of a yearslong diplomatic and economic tilt by Mr. Orban away from the West toward countries like China and Russia. It promises to put Hungary at the center of a wrenching and, for some, highly profitable green transition, with electric cars leading the way.

But residents in Mikepercs, a Fidesz stronghold in eastern Hungary, are seething over the arrival on nearby farmland of bulldozers and dump trucks preparing the way for the Chinese plant. Many worry the project would create pollution, drain their water supply and bring an influx of Chinese and other foreign workers.",https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/15/world/europe/hungary-china-battery-plant.html
CATL begins operations at new battery facility capable of producing one cell per second,2023-10-30,"CATL, the worldâs largest battery maker, is now becoming the fastest as well, thanks to state-of-the-art production lines at its new battery base in China. The developer says its new assembly lines can produce a battery cell per second and an entire EV battery pack in under three minutes.

CATL remains the undisputed leader in EV battery development, not only in China, where it is headquartered, but around the world. Despite a slight drop in net profits in Q3 of this year, CATL looks like it will maintain its crown in 2024 as the largest shareholder in the battery market â a title it has already held for six straight years.

CATLâs share of over 30% of the entire market is no accident either. It continues to develop and produce some of the most advanced battery tech out there. Its energy-dense Qilin batteries have begun rolling out within ZEEKR EVs out of China, and weâve even seen the company look to the skies by developing cells to support all-electric aviation.

The company has even introduced its own EV startup alongside Chinese tech company Huawei. In August, the company introduced a lithium-iron-phosphate (LFP) cell called ShenXing â capable of recouping 400km (249 miles) of range during a single 10-minute fast charge.

As CATLâs battery lineup continues to expand, so has its global production footprint. Just recently, the company began operations at a new production base in China, with assembly speeds that should help it keep a leg up on the competition.
