FREYR Battery Provides Operations Update,,"FREYR achieves important interim milestone by successfully conducting automated cathode casting trials

FREYR Battery (NYSE: FREY) (“FREYR” or the “Company”), a developer of clean, next-generation battery cell production capacity, has provided an update this morning on the company’s operational progress at the Customer Qualification Plant (“CQP”) in Mo i Rana, Norway.

Successful automated cathode casting trials

Following successful adjustments to the cathode casting equipment that included updates to the vacuum system, last week, FREYR’s teams at the CQP commenced automated cathode casting runs at a minimum nozzle distance of 0.26 mm.

The CQP teams have subsequently conducted successful cathode casting runs using the cathode web and solvent slurry at fixed nozzle distances of 0.5 mm and 1.0 mm, respectively, and at speeds of 2 meters per minute while using 100 psi of casting pressure. These successful automated cathode casting runs with solvent slurry were an important precursor to completing the Casting and Unit Cell Assembly commissioning packages and the eventual start of automated CQP production.

“I am very pleased to share that our teams at the CQP have reached another important interim technical milestone,” commented Mike Brose, FREYR’s Head of the Asset Mo team. “In doing so, our people and partners have demonstrated their collective ability to systematically link small but critical steps together to achieve the required outcome. We are able to integrate this vital part of the SemiSolidTM technology platform only because of the many milestones already completed together over the last several months by the FREYR Asset Mo team, our coworkers around the world, and our valued partners and suppliers. As we look forward to 2024, FREYR’s top priority is to finalize commissioning at the CQP and to begin automated production of in-spec, customer-testable batteries. With this latest milestone behind us, we will continue to apply unwavering focus to the remaining tasks that are necessary to achieve that goal.”

CQP commissioning status and key next steps

Following the successful automated cathode casting trials, FREYR has completed handovers of 342 (88%) of the 388 discrete production line equipment commissioning and testing packages at the CQP. The test center packages and handovers to operations are all complete.

The next technical requirements to stay on track with FREYR’s anticipated completion cadence at the CQP are:

Replicate the successful automated cathode casting trials with the anode production line system; and

Integrate the casting webs across the cathode, anode, and merge units of the Casting and Unit Cell Assembly equipment using the highly complex Multi-Carrier Systems (“MCS”) to reach automated cell production.

FREYR Battery concludes frame agreements for…,,"FREYR Battery concludes frame agreements for more than 90% of its raw material requirements for initial plants in Mo i Rana

New York, Oslo and Luxembourg, February 2, 2022, FREYR Battery (“FREYR”), a developer of clean, next-generation battery cell production capacity, has entered into nine frame agreements with key suppliers for the supply of battery materials required for the Customer Qualification Plant (“CQP”) being built in Mo i Rana, Norway. The remaining four frame agreements are in the final stages of negotiations. These frame agreements will be the basis for supply of raw materials to the CQP as well as to Gigafactories 1 and 2.

FREYR is on track to start the initial sample production of lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery cells in its CQP in the second half of 2022. The frame agreements described above will form the legal basis for the supply of the facility with cathode active material, anode active material, separators, electrolyte, Al-foil, Cu-foil, and insulation material, comprising more than 90% of the material required on both a value and volume basis. The next step will be to agree on volume and price for each raw material, after which FREYR will be in a position to issue purchase orders.

“We are very pleased to announce that we have made strong progress in establishing a framework that would allow us to secure a large part of the critical raw materials required for our initial production facilities,” said Dr. Tilo Hauke, EVP of Supply Chain in FREYR. “In an increasingly market short environment both for battery cells and raw materials, a core strategic focus for the company is to secure its supply chain,” he added.

FREYR has also entered into an agreement for localized supply of raw materials in the Nordics with Glencore, as well as a Heads of Terms for a JV with the Taiwanese company Aleees to establish giga production of LFP cathode materials in the region. This JV is expected to address the need to establish competitive European LFP cathode supply, which is currently primarily sourced from major producers in China. Both agreements demonstrate FREYR’s progress in delivering the supply of localized, low-carbon raw materials for Gigafactory battery-cell production in Norway and Finland.

FREYR has a stated ambition of sourcing all its raw materials locally to its Gigafactories in the Nordics and in the USA and base such supply on renewable energy sources. Localized raw material production based on renewable energy is a core part of enabling FREYR’s delivery of world-class battery solutions with the lowest possible carbon footprint.

“FREYR is targeting an 80% reduction in CO 2 e emissions on a full life cycle basis including logistics and recycling, documented through relevant Life Cycle Assessments (LCA). Enabling a localized supply chain for raw materials comprises close to half of this ambition and could add up to 31 kg CO 2 e saved per KWh of battery produced on top of the 33 kg CO 2 e saved per KWh by producing, packaging, and recycling battery cells in Norway and/or the Nordic region,” said Tom Einar Jensen, CEO and Co-Founder of FREYR Battery.

“At current (ETS) prices per ton of CO 2 e in the EU, which recently broke through 100 US$/t, these CO 2 e savings comprise a potential value of 6.3 US$/KWh of battery cell produced. Based on FREYR’s currently targeted production of 83 GWh in 2028 this translates to more than $500 million in yearly ‘de-carbonization value,” Jensen concluded.

FREYR is now actively working on documenting and validating the LCA aspects of the company’s ambitions and progress and how such value can accrue to the company and its partners.

FREYR drives development and production of…,,"FREYR drives development and production of next-generation battery cell technology

FREYR Battery is ramping up production at the Customer Qualification Plant (CQP) in Mo i Rana, Norway, taking the U.S. technology from 24M Technologies to GWh scale.

Back in November 2020, FREYR selected 24M as technology partner for lithium-ion cell manufacturing with their SemiSolidTM platform. The MIT-spinoff founded by Dr. Yet-Ming Chiang is already commercially introduced at MWh-scale in Asia, which was a key aspect in the selection process.

- The 24M technology is fundamentally improving and simplifying the production process compared to conventional Li-ion battery cells. We expect lower costs, lower energy consumption, and increased capacity per employee, says Dr. Andreas Bentzen, EVP Technology in FREYR, who has with close to 20 years of experience from the solar industry, including REC Group in Silicon Valley and Otovo which he also Co-Founded.

– The products we develop and put in production at the CQP will be inherently safer and more reliable, offer easier waste recovery and end-of-life recycling, as well as consuming less inactive materials.

Simplified manufacturing processes

FREYR is using a SemiSolidTM platform, where that the anode and cathode slurry has a clay-like composition much thicker than conventional Li-ion production, avoiding the needs for solvent evaporation and recovery. The number of unique process steps are significantly reduced, and the usage of inactive materials is much lower.

- Manufacturing Li-ion battery cells is a fast-moving production process with a high degree of automation and digitalization. We are using advanced technologies to drive accelerated learning in both our development and manufacturing processes, improving performance, and reducing waste, says Bentzen.

The simplified manufacturing process results in next-generation battery cells with several competitive advantages:",https://www.freyrbattery.com/news/freyr-drives-development-and-production-of-next-generation-battery-cell-technology
FREYR Battery Sanctions Construction of its Inaugural Gigafactory,,"Increases plant capacity to 29 GWh, based on $1.6 billion in identified debt financing support, catalyzed by the Norwegian National Battery Strategy and Norway’s Export Credit Agency Eksfin’s indication of up to EUR 400 million in loans and/or guarantees FREYR’s Board of Directors has sanctioned construction of Giga Arctic (combined Gigafactories 1 & 2), the company’s first battery manufacturing facility under development in Mo i Rana, Norway

FREYR is increasing the nameplate capacity of Giga Arctic to 29 GWh in response to improving battery supply-demand dynamics, ongoing commercial success, significant progress in developing supply chain channels for key raw materials and equipment, continued technical and product improvements, and project financing visibility

Earlier today at FREYR’s development site in Mo i Rana, the Norwegian Government outlined its National Battery Strategy, which includes significant support from Export Finance Norway (“Eksfin”) to assist FREYR with project financing of Giga Arctic

FREYR has identified total debt financing support of over $1.6 billion based on visibility from export credit agencies, multilateral development finance institutions and commercial banking partners, exceeding management’s leverage target for the $1.7 billion estimated total capital cost for the expanded Giga Arctic project

FREYR intends to contract approximately 50% of Giga Arctic’s capacity to long-term offtake partners and reserve the remaining volumes to address exponentially growing market demand, providing annual revenue generating capacity of $2 billion upon optimization of production systems and cell chemistry

Giga Arctic is expected to be one of the largest and most efficient battery facilities in Europe, with 50% lower anticipated capital spending per GWh of nameplate capacity and more than 200% higher production per employee than conventional Lithium-Ion battery plants in production today

FREYR is raising its installed annual production capacity target to more than 200 GWh by 2030, twice the company’s previous ambition

FREYR has recently secured a conditional offtake agreement (“COA”) with a major European energy technology customer for 25 GWh of battery cells from 2024 to 2028, in addition to the more than 100 GWh of previously announced COAs

FREYR Battery (NYSE: FREY) (“FREYR”), a developer of clean, next-generation battery cell production capacity, announced today that the company’s Board of Directors (“The Board”) has approved the expansion of the planned Giga Arctic project under development in Mo i Rana, Norway, to an annual nameplate capacity of 29 GWh. FREYR’s Board of Directors has also approved the construction of Giga Arctic. The approval follows substantial completion of detailed plant engineering; the establishment of procurement frameworks with key raw material and capital equipment suppliers; and the announcements of conditional offtake agreements totaling more than 125 GWh from the planned start of production in 1H-2024 through 2030. Groundworks at the site are well advanced and the company has recently started casting foundation structures.

The Board’s decision coincides with the announcement of a letter of intent indicating loans and/or guarantees of up to €400 million from Eksfin, Norway’s export credit agency (“ECA”), and the recently announced National Battery Strategy by the Norwegian Government, which outlines meaningful governmental support for the developing battery industry in Norway.

“If we are to reach the goals in the Paris agreement, batteries will need to be produced in a more sustainable way with the lowest CO2 footprint possible. It is therefore important for Norway to define a clear direction and set ambitious goals for battery production in our country. The National Battery Strategy that we just launched, defines ten areas of key importance that will facilitate private investments so that companies along the entire value chain can set up sustainable and successful businesses in Norway. Our unmatched access to renewable energy makes batteries produced in Norway the greenest in the world. I am therefore very pleased and excited that FREYR Battery is moving along with its plans to establish a Gigafactory in Norway based on state capital and risk relief. It is an important confirmation that public and private partnerships are important to be successful in creating the green industry of the future,” said the Minister of Trade and Industry, Jan Christian Vestre.

“Today marks another significant milestone for FREYR on our path to giga-scale production of clean battery solutions. With our expanded plant capacity, accelerating commercial momentum, and strong support from Eksfin, other ECAs and financial institutions, Giga Arctic represents one of Norway’s largest industrial investments onshore in recent decades,” said Torstein Dale Sjøtveit, Founder and Executive Chairman of FREYR.

Governmental Support and Gigafactory Financing Plan

Today, the Norwegian Government announced the key elements of its National Battery Strategy at FREYR’s facilities in Mo i Rana, Norway. With the expected financial backing catalyzed by this strategy and support from other European governmental entities, FREYR has identified over $1.6 billion of potential debt financing support to fund development of Giga Arctic, including:

A letter of intent received from Eksfin indicating loans and/or guarantees of up to €400 million;

Anticipated loan guarantees exceeding $800 million from ECAs of three OECD countries based on capital equipment order frameworks for Giga Arctic from the same plant equipment suppliers to FREYR’s Customer Qualification Plant;

Indications of support received from multilateral development finance institutions, which include potential loans of $300 million from the European Investment Bank (“EIB”) and $50 million to $100 million from the Nordic Investment Bank (“NIB”), respectively; and

Targeted project financing from a consortium of commercial banks led by initial mandated lead arrangers Societe Generale and DNB, which are now formally launching the project financing process.

In addition, FREYR had $523 million of cash on its balance sheet as of March 31, 2022, and currently has multiple grant applications pending decision.

Tone Lunde Bakker, Chief Executive Officer of Eksfin, added, “Export Finance Norway's most important task is to offer capital and risk relief to the green, Norwegian export industry. Long-term partnerships between state and private capital are needed to realize the transition to a zero-emission society; create local jobs; and take leading positions internationally. FREYR Battery’s factory can play a key role in building a powerful, high-tech value chain within batteries in Norway and the Nordic countries. Eksfin has therefore indicated participation in the financing of the project in collaboration with other financiers and investors. We wish FREYR good luck in the next, exciting phase and look forward to working closely with the growing Norwegian battery industry.”

Giga Arctic Development

The sanctioned Giga Arctic construction project includes eight production lines, a battery testing center, administrative facilities, and infrastructure at an estimated total capital cost of $1.7 billion. The updated cost relative to FREYR’s initial business plan, which was finalized in February 2021, is attributable to the following:

A 150% increase in nameplate capacity on a chemistry equivalent basis to 29 GWh from the initial plan to construct two smaller Gigafactories in Mo i Rana 1 ;

; Technical modifications and enhancements to the plant and its products that are intended to improve operational efficiency and economic returns; and

Inflationary pressures and supply chain challenges.

FREYR has engineered and positioned Giga Arctic to be the most capital efficient battery plant in Europe, with 50% lower estimated capital expenditures per installed GWh of capacity compared to plants currently in operation or under construction. The company also expects Giga Arctic to be the most operationally efficient battery plant in Europe, generating an anticipated 200% higher production per plant employee compared to estimated averages at conventional Lithium-Ion battery facilities. These expected efficiencies are aided by FREYR’s recently announced long-term power purchase agreement (“PPA”) with Statkraft. Giga Arctic is expected to benefit from 100% renewable energy at prices that FREYR estimates to be substantially below those of other battery producing regions, while using less energy in production through the 24M Technologies SemiSolidTM cell manufacturing process and platform.

FREYR is also evaluating additional enhancements to the Giga Arctic development that include module and pack manufacturing, recycling and other applications which could add approximately $250 million of additional capital expenditures. Management expects the above investments to generate highly accretive returns on capital for the project should the company move forward with these initiatives. In addition, the company continues to evaluate its proposed joint venture with Aleees for a Nordic LFP cathode materials manufacturing plant.

Tom Einar Jensen, FREYR’s Chief Executive Officer, concluded, “Since our NYSE listing in July 2021, FREYR has made incredible progress on its goal of providing clean battery solutions to the world through speed, scale, and sustainability. Despite supply chain challenges and inflation, the fundamentals have never been better for the battery industry given the largest secular shift in human history towards the energy transition to address the climate emergency; the immediate need for energy security, localized power generation and storage; and the accelerating adoption of electric vehicles and battery energy storage systems. FREYR is playing a key role in addressing energy cost inflation, energy security and climate change.”
