Electric vehicle battery production in Europe gets boost thanks to EIB loan of €480 million to LG Chem Wroclaw Energy in Poland,2020-03-26,"First EIB loan to LG Chem Group and its Polish subsidiary will support the construction of manufacturing facilities for advanced lithium-ion cells and batteries for battery-powered electric vehicles

The project will contribute to the clean energy transition and the shift towards electrification of the European transport industry and secure the supply of advanced li-ion batteries for European car makers

The project will have important spillovers with technological transfer, the creation of around 1 800 jobs and research and development activities in Poland

The European Investment Bank (EIB) has signed a €480 million loan agreement with LG Chem Wroclaw Energy, the Polish subsidiary of the LG Chem Group that was established to develop the group’s battery production facility in Europe. The financing will be used for the construction and operation of highly automated and innovative manufacturing facilities for advanced lithium-ion (li-ion) cells and batteries for battery-powered electric vehicles (BEVs). The EIB financing will cover around a third of the total project costs, estimated at €1.5 billion. The remainder will come from the company’s own resources and from other financing sources.

The additional manufacturing facilities will be located on the industrial site of LG Chem Wroclaw Energy in south-west Poland.

The project supplements smaller production facilities on the same site and presents several novelties, including a fully smart factory with several newly developed cutting-edge technologies to mass-produce the latest generation of high energy density li-ion electrodes, cells, modules and battery packs, thereby significantly improving energy density, fast-charging capability, safety and cost efficiency.

The EIB-backed project will have an annual production capacity of over 35 GWh, which can potentially power more than 500 000 zero-emission electric cars per year and therefore contribute to the transition from fossil fuel-powered internal combustion engine-based vehicles toward electromobility and sustainable transport.

Teresa Czerwinska, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank, who oversees operations in Poland, said: “This first EIB operation with LG Chem Wroclaw Energy is significant for many reasons. It helps Europe to build a critical mass in electric vehicle battery production at a pivotal time of electric vehicle commercialisation in Europe; it promotes a shift to electromobility and to a greener automotive industry; and it helps create new qualified jobs in an industrial region in transition to a new economic model. Today’s operation proves that with the right partners and the right projects in place we can combine cohesion objectives with innovation and strong climate action.”

Jeong Joon Ha, CFO of LG Chem Wroclaw Energy Sp. z o.o., said: “We would like to express our gratitude to the EIB team. The loan provides our company with the resources to create a competitive battery value chain in Europe and Poland. Furthermore, it enables the LG Chem Group to take the lead in terms of growth of the European battery market and community development.”

LG Chem’s increasing commitment in Europe and in Poland is expected to positively contribute to the development of the European electric vehicles battery market. This includes a potential expansion of the relevant supply chain and the accumulation of critical knowledge, particularly in the area of battery production technologies, creating an eco-system that will help develop innovative solutions for this emerging industry in Europe. The investment has already attracted over a dozen specialised component suppliers and service companies to set up shop in the region with a view to supplying LG Chem as well as other industrial players. Moreover, the company plans to further enhance existing cooperation programmes with the Technical University of Wroclaw for developing dedicated studies, internships and training. In parallel, the company will expand its technology centre in Wroclaw in order to further improve production processes and develop next generation batteries.

The implementation of the new investment programme will enable the company to ramp up its battery capacity output to ca. 65 GWh, making the Polish facility one of the largest lithium-ion cell factories in the world. Moreover, more than 1 800 jobs will be created at the Wroclaw site, taking the total workforce up to more than 6 000 full-time employees by end-2022.

one hundred hectares of surface area

the cost of the investment exceeding 3 billion euro

The industry of electric cars and batteries that power them has developed dynamically in recent years. Poland is the European leader in the production of electric cars and batteries, overtaking Germany. Experts from the automotive sector emphasize that Poland's leading position in this ranking was determined by the investment of Korean LG Energy Solution located in Biskupice Podgórne near Wroclaw.

- Electromobility is the future - we in Wroclaw know that very well. I'm glad that the world leader in this industry operates and develops in our agglomeration. LG Energy Solution Wroclaw also enjoys a reputation of a good employer, employing thousands of people and stimulating the creation of new jobs among sub-suppliers.

LG Energy Solution Wroclaw batteries for electric cars

Korean concern LG Chem - the parent company of LG Energy Solution - started developing batteries for the automotive industry back in 2000. Less than 10 years later, it was the first company in the world to supply such batteries to Hyundai Motors and became the exclusive battery supplier for General Motors.

Contracting more customers and the dynamic development of the industry required increasing the production capacity of the company.

- Back in 2009, construction of a battery factory in Ochang, Korea, began, a year later in Michigan, USA, and in 2015 a twin plant was built in Nanjing, China.

- In 2016, construction began on LG Chem Wroclaw Energy - Europe's first battery manufacturer for electric cars.
