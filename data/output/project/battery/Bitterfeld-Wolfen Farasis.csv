""Electric first"": Mercedes-Benz continues its strategy in the transformation to C02-neutral mobility: Mercedes-Benz announces strategic partnership and equity stake in battery cell manufacturer Farasis

Stuttgart. Mercedes-Benz is taking another important step on its journey towards CO2--neutral mobility. The Stuttgart-based luxury car manufacturer has launched a far-reaching strategic partnership with the Chinese battery cell manufacturer Farasis Energy (Ganzhou) Co., Ltd., including taking an equity stake. This move represents another important milestone towards Mercedes-Benz’s “Ambition2039” CO2-neutral goal. Key elements of the agreement include the development and industrialization of highly advanced cell technologies, accompanied by ambitious goals for cost competitiveness. The technological focus is on significant increases in range through advances in energy density and the reduction of charging times. The contract will provide a secure source of supply of battery cells for Mercedes-Benz’s electrification strategy, while Farasis gains security for its planned construction of production capacity. In order to be able to meet increasing demand for German Mercedes-Benz plants in the future, Farasis is building a plant for battery cells in Bitterfeld-Wolfen; creating up to 2,000 new jobs. The East German site is designed as a CO2-neutral factory from the start.

„We are very pleased to further expand our partnership with Farasis in taking a decisive step within the implementation of our electric strategy 'Electric first'. By strategically expanding our business relationship, we are pushing the electrification of our model portfolio ahead. With this agreement, we contribute our expertise in the field of battery cell development. At the same time, we are providing a boost for Farasis's new plant and promoting the sustainable development of a key technology and its establishment in Germany. We share with our partner the common vision of a more sustainable world through CO2-neutral mobility“, says Markus Schäfer, Member of the Board of Management of Daimler AG and Mercedes-Benz AG, responsible for Daimler Group Research and Mercedes-Benz Cars COO.

Hubertus Troska, Member of the Board of Management of Daimler AG, responsible for Greater China says: ""China is the world’s largest electric car market with tremendous potential for further development. We are already working with strong and trusted partners in China, not only to enhance our local footprint but also to strengthen our competitiveness worldwide. By taking a stake in a Chinese battery cell manufacturer for the first time, we will further leverage the potential of advanced technology partners in the market, enabling us to pursue our electric strategy globally. In the future, we will continue to strengthen our activities in research and development, production and purchasing in China.""

With this strategic partnership Mercedes-Benz is deepening its sustainability activities and further strengthening its existing business relationship with the battery cell supplier by taking a stake of around three percent. To this end, Daimler Greater China is investing a multi-million euro amount as part of Farasis' IPO. This equity stake is conditional upon required regulatory approvals. It will give Daimler the option to nominate a representative for a seat on the supervisory board of the battery cell manufacturer. Markus Schäfer, Member of the Board of Management of Daimler AG and Mercedes-Benz AG, responsible for Daimler Group Research and Mercedes-Benz Cars COO would intend to take the seat after a period of 12 months subject to regulatory approval of voting process.

Current contracts with Farasis have been supplemented and include, in addition to technical and commercial contractual components, expanded legal and sustainability requirements. Under certain technological and commercial conditions, the supplier can join projects for the next generations of the Mercedes-Benz EQ products at an early stage. As a strategic partner, Farasis is a fixed cornerstone in the existing set of Mercedes-Benz battery cell suppliers. A balanced supplier set is the basis for access to the best possible technology and a prerequisite for competitiveness.

Mercedes-Benz continues to invest in advanced battery expertise

The intelligence of the battery lies in a highly complex overall system. It defines the characteristics of an electric vehicle in terms of power, range and charging time. Mercedes-Benz is taking a comprehensive approach across the whole battery technology chain - from research and development to series production. The cell is at the very heart of the battery and mastering its chemistry is therefore critical. The clear development goal is to significantly increase the range of future batteries through advances in energy density, to advance the production maturity of future battery technologies and, last but not least, to significantly reduce charging times. The increased efficiency of future batteries will further improve the sustainability of electric vehicles. This starts with the reduction of the use of critical materials and the CO2-neutral production of the cells, and goes through the efficiency in operation to recycling and a closed raw material cycle. Together with its partners, Mercedes-Benz is also driving the fastest possible industrialization of new technologies.

Local battery production is also an important success factor for the company’s electrification strategy and the key element in being able to flexibly and efficiently meet the global demand for electric vehicles. Within its global production network, Mercedes-Benz focuses on the production of highly efficient battery systems and the establishment of a global battery production network. In the future, it will consist of nine factories at seven locations on three continents.

Mercedes-Benz buys battery cells from various partners in the world market, to secure access to the latest technologies as well as ensure the supply to its global production network. Through in-depth know-how in the development and production of highly complex drive systems and research and development expertise in the field of cell production, Mercedes-Benz is involved with its suppliers in meeting the requisite specifications.

Sustainability as an integral part of the partnership

Mercedes-Benz and Farasis had already agreed on a sustainability partnership in the summer of 2019. The first result was the production of battery cells with electricity from renewable energies such as hydropower, wind and solar energy. For example, the next generation of EQ vehicles, including the EQS luxury sedan, will in part be equipped with CO2-neutral battery cells. Daimler Greater China's investment in the battery cell manufacturer is actively driving forward the development of a key technology for electric mobility and its industrialization. In China, the battery cell supplier has built a plant in Zhenjiang that will be CO2-neutral. A production site in Bitterfeld-Wolfen in eastern Germany is currently being planned and will be CO2-neutral from the start. An additional plant in the U.S. will follow. This is in line with the Mercedes-Benz strategy of buying where production takes place.

Accelerating Electrification across the entire vehicle portfolio

As part of the ""Electric first"" strategy, Mercedes-Benz is implementing the electrification of all model variants and vehicle types. In less than 20 years, the Mercedes-Benz new car fleet will be CO2-neutral, and by 2030 the company aims to ensure that more than 50 percent of its passenger car sales are plug-in hybrids or all-electric vehicles. Fully electric Mercedes-Benz trucks, vans and buses are already in series production today. By the end of this year, the goal is to have five fully electric passenger car models and 20 plug-in hybrid variants on the market. The plug-in hybrid portfolio ranges from model variants from the A- to S-Class, from the GLA to the GLE with electric ranges of up to 100 kilometres.

The model offensive also continues with purely battery-electric vehicles. Already available are the fully electric Mercedes-Benz EQC models (EQC 400 4MATIC combined power consumption: 20.8-19.7 kWh/100 km; combined CO2 emissions: 0 g/km)[1], the three smart EQ models, and the EQV 300 (combined power consumption: 26.4-26.3 kWh/100 km; combined CO2 emissions: 0 g/km)[2]. Purely electric variants in the compact segment, as well as the purely electric EQS for sustainable luxury in the premium segment, are also coming soon.

Bitterfeld-Wolfen is cancelling contract with Farasis,2022-05-04 00:00:00,"The planned battery cell factory of Daimler partner Farasis Energy in Bitterfeld-Wolfen (Saxony-Anhalt) is probably not going to happen. According to a German media report, Bitterfeld-Wolfen has terminated the urban development contract with Farasis Energy Europe. The company has confirmed the move but the connection has not been completely cut.

Farasis Energy had chosen Bitterfeld-Wolfen as the location for its European battery factory in 2019. According to the announcement at the time, the first battery cells were to be built on-site from the end of 2022, and subsequently, the capacity was to be expanded to up to ten GWh per year.

However, despite all the contracts, Farasis never started building the plant in the German federal state of Saxony-Anhalt. Most recently, there was talk of a possible start of production in 2024. Officially, an update of the localisation strategy in Europe was given as the reason – to our German colleagues at electrive.net this reasoning was repeated as recently as this February.

According to a newspaper report in Mitteldeutsche Zeitung (MZ), the city of Bitterfeld-Wolfen has now lost patience. The town council’s resolution documents are said to state that the urban development contract with Farasis Energy Europe had been terminated, thus “ensuring a clear file situation”. Farasis told MZ that “the contract was terminated by mutual agreement”.

While Farasis still said in February that in the course of the update it would also be examined how things would continue in Bitterfeld, this process has now apparently been concluded: Farasis now told MZ that “the dynamic market development has led to a shift in priorities, which is why we have postponed the concretisation of our plans for the Bitterfeld-Wolfen site for the time being.”

However, it remains to be seen whether the city will go along with Farasis’ officially postponed plans. The MZ report mentions a certain annoyance on the part of the city. Farasis apparently did not provide “the necessary precise information for further processing of the development plan pushed through by the city itself […] even after repeated requests and warnings from the city of Bitterfeld-Wolfen”. In addition, there was apparently interest from other companies in the still undeveloped areas near the motorway.

As the city administration states, after the termination of the contract with Farasis, the city is now “once again the master of the process”. So the city is once again solely responsible for the development plan. But the big problem is that Farasis still owns the land. Lord Mayor Armin Schenk (CDU) also indicated to the MZ that the connection to Farasis has not been completely cut. “We are continuing to talk,” Schenk said. “It’s a big property owner.”

Incidentally, it is not clear what conclusion Farasis has come to in revising its Europa plans. Whether the European plant will be built at another location or Farasis will supply its customers from its plants in China, like Mercedes-Benz, is currently open.

Mercedes invests in battery production with Farasis,2020-07-03 00:00:00,"Mercedes-Benz has agreed a strategic partnership with the Chinese battery cell manufacturer Farasis Energy and is also taking a financial stake in the Ganzhou-based company. Farasis’ already planned plant in Bitterfeld-Wolfen will then primarily supply the German Mercedes plants.

After both companies concluded a sustainability partnership for battery cells in September 2019, the Stuttgart-based car manufacturer is now acquiring a stake of around three per cent in Farasis Energy with “a multi-million euro amount”. This gives Daimler the opportunity to nominate a representative for a seat on the battery cell manufacturer’s supervisory board. The investment is subject to any necessary regulatory approvals.

The logic behind the agreement: Mercedes-Benz receives a commitment to secure supplies of battery cells for the upcoming electric offensive, while Farasis receives planning security for capacity expansion. “With this agreement, we contribute our expertise in the field of battery cell development,” says Markus Schäfer, who is responsible for Group Research on the Board of Management of Daimler AG and acts as COO of the Mercedes-Benz Passenger Cars division. “At the same time, we are providing a boost for Farasis’s new plant and promoting the sustainable development of key technology and its establishment in Germany.” Incidentally, according to the Daimler announcement, Schäfer intends to take over the seat on the Farasis Supervisory Board.

In order to be able to meet the increasing demand for the German Mercedes-Benz plants in the future, Farasis is building a plant for battery cells in Bitterfeld-Wolfen and is expected to create up to 2,000 new jobs. According to earlier statements, a capacity of 6 GWh is to be reached from 2022, later 10 GWh are targeted.

Instead, the company repeats earlier statements that local battery production is an important factor in the success of the electrical offensive. By this, however, Daimler primarily means battery assembly plants where purchased cells are assembled into modules and ready-to-install packs. This “global battery production network” will in the future consist of nine factories at seven locations on three continents – in Germany, for example, this is to take place in Kamenz.

The battery cells from Farasis could soon be followed by other components that Daimler procures from Chinese companies. China board member Hubertus Troska announces that the company’s first-time participation in a Chinese battery cell manufacturer is intended to “further leverage the potential of advanced technology partners in the market, enabling us to pursue our electric strategy globally. In the future, we will continue to strengthen our activities in research and development, production and purchasing in China,” Troska said.

"Farasis, rethinking battery factory plans in Germany",2021-07-12 20:44:10+00:00,"Farasis, rethinking battery factory plans in Germany.

[Market Research Telecast] The construction of the planned battery factory of the Chinese manufacturer and Daimler supplier Farasis in Bitterfeld-Wolfen could come under further scrutiny. Upon request, the company announced that it was revising its Europe-wide “localization strategy”. This is about the decision as to which battery cells are to be produced where.

The company left unanswered questions about the extent to which the construction of the planned factory in Saxony-Anhalt would be delayed or whether the construction of the factory could be overturned. All that was said was that Bitterfeld was still part of “potential localization strategies”. More details on the revised strategy will be made within the next six weeks.

The Handelsblatt had reported that the project in Bitterfeld may not even come about, but at least a delay in construction of around two years until autumn 2024 can be assumed.

The factory was supposed to open in 2022. According to earlier information, Farasis wanted to invest around 600 million euros for this. 600 jobs were to be created. According to previous ideas, the location should also become the Group’s new European headquarters. Farasis was founded in California in 2002 and is now based in Ganzhou, China. The company has its German headquarters in Frickenhausen near Esslingen.

Farasis is one of several battery cell suppliers to the car manufacturer Daimler. The Stuttgart-based company builds the batteries for their electric cars themselves. So far, they have bought most of the cells that are in the batteries. Farasis emphasized that deliveries to Daimler are ongoing and will also be secured for the future. A Daimler spokesman rejected speculations that the cooperation between the two companies had meanwhile broken down. The cooperation continues.

Mercedes deal catapults Farasis into the battery big time,2020-07-06 06:59:33+00:00,"Mercedes deal catapults Farasis into the battery big time Business news | July 6, 2020 By Nick Flaherty











Mercedes-Benz has signed a key strategic partnership with the Chinese battery cell manufacturer Farasis Energy that includes its battery gigafactory and R&D centre in Germany.

The deal makes Farasis the ‘anchor’ battery supplier for the German car maker as it moves to an ‘electric first’ strategy and includes a stake around three percent and a seat on the board.

The agreement includes the development and industrialization of new battery cell technologies with higher energy density and fast charging, along with with significant cost reductions. While Mercedes and Daimler will continue to use cells from Chinese supplier CATL, the move to a new cell technology for future designs will restrict the choice of battery supplier.

The deal catapults Farasis into the group of major global battery suppliers alongside CATL, Panasonic, LG Chem, Samsung SDI and BYD. All bar Panasonic have, or are building, battery gigactory plants in Europe alongside plants from local companies such as NorthVolt, BMZ and Saft. Farasis has a production plants in Ganzhou and a newly opened plant in Zhenjiang, and is building its new battery gigafactory in Bitterfeld-Wolfen. This is set to start production later this year with an annual target of 6GWh, rising to 10GWh a year. The company has an agreement to supply 140GWh of battery cells to Daimler up to 2027.

Mercedes says the deal will provide a secure source of supply of battery cells, highlighting the intense competition betwen car makers for battery supply. Farasis gains security for its planned construction of production capacity in China and Germany, where the battery gigafactory will create up to 2,000 new jobs and is designed as a CO₂-neutral factory from the start. A US battery gigafactory is also planned.

“We are very pleased to further expand our partnership with Farasis in taking a decisive step within the implementation of our electric strategy ‘electric first’,” said Markus SchäferMember of the Board of Management of Daimler and Mercedes-Benz. He is responsible for Daimler Group Research and the chief operating officer of Mercedes-Benz Cars and will take a seat on teh Farasis board after 12 months subject to regulatory approval.

Farasis to locate battery plant in Saxony-Anhalt,2019-05-09 00:00:00,"U.S. American battery manufacturer, Farasis Energy, plans to build an electric car battery production plant in Bitterfeld-Wolfen in Saxony-Anhalt. The battery giant wants to invest more than 600 million euros in the new plant with its newly founded subsidiary, Farasis Energy Europe.

The Saxony-Anhalt Ministry of Economy, Science and Digitalisation announced that Farasis will be producing battery cells as well as modules and packs. The plant that will be located on the former site of Solar Valley in the south-west German town of Bitterfeld-Wolfen. From the end of 2022, the production capacity is to be continuously expanded from an initial 6 to 10 GWh per year for purely electric vehicles. This could be used to equip some 60,000 to 80,000 electric cars.

Farasis Energy Europe GmbH was founded just this year with headquarters in Stuttgart. With this in mind, a team of experienced battery experts have been leading the search for their European factory location since the middle of last year. “We focused on four main groups of decision criteria, with particular emphasis on site quality and environmental protection,” notes Dr Maik Cordes, Head of Business Development at Farasis Europe.

The European head of Farasis Energy, Sebastian Wolf, said that the “Made in Germany” label was a decisive factor in the decision to locate the plant in Bitterfeld-Wolfen. He explained that European automakers were keen to use batteries made in the continent since the vast majority of battery production sites are currently in Asia. Wolf said that he will also be moving to Bitterfeld-Wolfen himself and that the company wants to relocate their European headquarters to Bitterfeld-Wolfen. “We are in contact with all major automobile manufacturers in Europe. And there is also lively interest in our products,” Wolf continued.

In the final expansion phase, the plant will create at least 600 new jobs. Approximately 270 automotive suppliers are located in Saxony-Anhalt and employ 23,000 people. Minister of Economic Affairs for the state, Armin Willingmann said: “It is good that this is continuing and that the industry is looking to the future, and that is unquestionably electromobility”.

Farasis Energy Europe is participating in the expression of interest procedure of the Federal Ministry of Economics and Energy (BMWi) for a project of common European interest (IPCEI) in the field of battery cell production. This would enable Farasis Energy Europe to benefit from state aid through European Commission regulations.

Founded in California in 2002, the mother company, Farasis, currently employs more than 3,500 people worldwide and operates research centres in the USA and China. The U.S. firm currently has its headquarters in China as well as two manufacturing plants (in Ganzhou and Zhenjiang). This makes Farasis the third largest manufacturer of batteries for electric vehicles in China and the world’s second largest supplier of batteries in pouch cell format. Now they want to expand and gain a foothold in the European market.
