CATL To Open 8 GWh Battery Cell Plant In Germany Later This Year,2022-04-06,"The world's largest electric vehicle battery manufacturer, Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Limited (CATL), has received the second partial approval for the commissioning of a new cell plant in Thuringia, a state in the eastern part of Germany.

CATL's first battery cell production facility outside of China will have an initial capacity of 8 GWh per year, with plans to increase it to 14 GWh over time.

The Chinese battery maker broke ground on Germany's first battery cell factory in 2019 at the Erfurter Kreuz industrial area in Amt Wachsenburg, Thuringia. Construction of the plant is now in the final stage and the installation of machines is in full swing.

The company expects the first cells to roll off the assembly lines by the end of 2022, when the plant will employ some 1,500 people. Eventually, the Chinese battery giant plants to achieve a production capacity of 14 GWh and create 2,000 jobs in Germany after a total investment of €1.8 billion ($2 billion).

The site consists of two buildings: G1, an existing building purchased from another company and where cells are assembled to modules, and G2, a newly-built plant where cells will be produced. The approval on Monday was issued to permit cell production in the G2 building.

CATL's German subsidiary operates as Contemporary Amperex Technology Thuringia GmbH (CATT).

""CATT provides a fundamental impetus for the urgently needed energy transition, and we are glad to be the first company to receive approval to manufacture batteries 'Made in Germany.'"" Matthias Zentgraf, CATL's President for Europe

CATL says the plant is almost as complex as a chip factory, featuring clean rooms, technical cleanliness and constant humidity. The factory generates part of its power from the solar power panels on the rooftop of the building.

The new battery cell manufacturing facility in Germany marks a significant milestone for CATL's global footprint expansion. It remains to be seen whether the Thuringia factory will supply Tesla's new Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg, located some 330 kilometers northeast.

CATL is one of Tesla's main battery cell suppliers, especially in China where the battery packs of the Shanghai-made Model 3 and Model Y EVs mostly feature CATL's lithium iron phosphate (LFP) cells.",https://insideevs.com/news/578233/catl-open-8gwh-battery-cell-plant-germany-later-this-year/
CATL takes off – Europe’s largest cell production facility starts production,2023-05-05 00:00:00,"Thuringia is home to one of the largest investments of this kind in Europe and marked a major milestone at the beginning of the year: Chinese global market leader Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Ltd. (CATL) is building its first battery cell manufacturing facility outside of China in the industry park “Erfurter Kreuz” and officially launched its local production of lithium-ion cells at the end of January. CATL is investing around EUR 2 billion in what is currently Europe’s largest cell production facility; up to 2,000 jobs will be created.

After delays caused by Corona, production was set up according to plan: Production initially started on two module lines, and by the end of 2023 the planned six lines are scheduled to go into operation, generating an output of 24 GWh/a. In the meantime, the number of employees has grown to around 1,000. Thuringia's Minister President Bodo Ramelow, Economics Minister Tiefensee, Environment Minister Anja Siegesmund and representatives of LEG Thüringen, who have intensively accompanied this investment, took part in the inauguration ceremony. At the site south of the Thuringian capital of Erfurt, the company focuses not only on manufacturing but also on research and development and in the nearby Erfurt cargo hub the CATL European logistics headquarters are established. Thuringia is fast evolving into one of Europe’s most innovative regions for the future of mobility, especially electric vehicles. For example, the state recently funded the establishment of the new Battery Innovation and Technology Center (BITC), which is already partnering with CATL.

CATL is committed to sustainability and green manufacturing,2022-06-20 00:00:00,"Please give us a picture: What is the status of work on the new plant in Thuringia?

CATL broke ground on its German plant (CATT) in 2019. The plant in Arnstadt consists of two buildings: G1, an existing building purchased from another company, where battery module production has begun in Q3 2021, and G2, a newly-built plant, where the equipment installation and commissioning is currently in full swing. In April 2022, CATL received approval for battery cell production from the state of Thuringia. With a total investment of 1.8 billion euro, CATL plans to achieve a production capacity of 14GWh and create 2,000 jobs in Germany in the future.

What is the time horizon for the start of production?

CATL started battery modules production in Q3 2021, and is expected to start cell production by the end of 2022.

The CATL plant in Sichuan has been certified as the first plant in the so-called new energy industry “Zero Carbon Factory” – i.e. as a plant that produces CO2-neutrally. In Germany, this is also very important. Do you plan to do the same for Thuringia?

Our Yibin plant, which has achieved carbon neutrality through hydropower consumption, energy-saving smart plant management system, and electric mobility, was certified as the world’s first zero-carbon battery factory this March. We will replicate these advanced experience in all of our production facilities including teh Thuringian plant, thus reducing carbon footprint throughout the life cycle of batteries.

CATL is committed to green manufacturing and is poised to reduce carbon emissions through a variety of measures such as utilization of green electricity and smart plant energy management system. We are also building a photovoltaic system at the rooftop of G2 building to generate green electricity to power the plant.

CATL Starts Series Production Of EV Battery Cells In Germany,2022-12-27,"Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Limited (CATL), the world's largest electric vehicle battery manufacturer, announced that its new lithium-ion battery cell plant in Germany started series production ""as scheduled"".

The Contemporary Amperex Technology Thuringia GmbH (CATT) in Thuringia is the company's first factory outside of China. It was announced in 2018 as part of a business deal with BMW Group.

Construction of the site started in 2019. In Q3 2021, the G1 facility began production of battery modules (one module might consist of multiple cells), while the new G2 battery cell facility received approval in April 2022 and this month it came online.

The initial manufacturing capacity is estimated at 8 Gigawatt hour per year, although in the future, it's expected to reach 14 GWh per year. According to CATL, at a total investment of up to $1.9 billion (€1.8 billion) up to 2,000 new jobs will be created in Germany.

Matthias Zentgraf, CATL's president for Europe said:

""The production kickoff proves that we kept our promise to our customers as a reliable partner of the industry and we stay committed to Europe's e-mobility transition even under very challenging conditions like the pandemic. We are working hard to ramp up production to full capacity, which is our top priority for the coming year.""

The company does not elaborate on the cell form factor or battery chemistry, but we guess that it's the prismatic form factor.

CATL is currently investing an even higher amount - $7.8 billion (€1.8 billion) - in a much larger battery plant project in Hungary, which is set for 100 GWh of batteries annually. This new factory will produce battery cells for various plug-in car manufacturers, including the all-new cylindrical battery cells for BMW Group.

Globally, CATL is the largest battery supplier for electric cars with a 33% market share as of the first half of 2022 and an average output of well over 10 GWh per month. The company produces LFP-, NCM- and other battery chemistries, as well as battery system solutions, including cell-to-pack systems, which eliminates the necessity of modules inside the battery pack enclosure.

Currently, the company is considering whether one of its new plants will be built in North America.",https://insideevs.com/news/628393/catl-started-production-battery-cells-germany/
CATL is building a gigafactory for batteries in Thuringia,2018-07-24 00:00:00,"A major success for the investment location Thuringia: The Chinese company Contemporary Amperex Technology Ltd. (CATL), one of the leading car battery producers worldwide, is building its first factory outside of China in Arnstadt, south of the state’s capital of Erfurt.

CATL will invest 240 million euros and create 600 new jobs by 2022. With a capacity of 14 gigawatt hours, the focus of the factory will be on automated production and intelligent manufacturing of batteries. In addition to production, research and development, quality control and high-quality services will play a major role.

The central location of Thuringia, the good infrastructure at the site, the investor service, the availability of qualified experts and the multiple research capacities are among the trump cards which convinced CATL and tipped the balance in the tough worldwide competition between regions. “This significant investment decision catapults our state into the European league at least, since here is where the first ever European production location for battery cells is emerging,” explains Wolfgang Tiefensee, Thuringia’s Minister for Economic Affairs, who himself led the negotiations in China, at the signing of the project agreement in the Federal Chancellery in Berlin at the beginning of July. “We are glad that a world market leader like CATL is relying on Thuringia to accelerate growth of its battery and production technology from here.” CATL will establish its production plant in the “Erfurter Kreuz” industrial park, which has been successfully developed by the State Development Corporation of Thuringia (LEG) since 2005. LEG is energetically supporting the investment project with its competent investor service.

"CATL’s battery plant in Germany, its first outside of China, receives production approval for 8 GWh per year",2022-04-06 00:00:00,"Battery manufacturing behemoth, CATL, shared news that its upcoming plant in Thuringia, Germany has received 2nd partial approval for cell production. This milestone brings the Chinese company one step closer to opening its first battery manufacturing facility outside of China later this year.

Contemporary Amperex Technology Co Ltd., better known as CATL, is a global energy technology company and the leading EV battery manufacturer in China. It’s expansive presence in the battery world has helped solidify its reign as the world’s largest by installed battery capacity for a fifth-straight year.

The company has made recent efforts to integrate more sustainability into the battery manufacturing process, announcing a new $5 billion recycling facility as well as a zero-carbon plant in China. Despite these new facilities to support its goal of global carbon neutrality, CATL has yet to expand outside its home in China… at least for now.

In 2019, CATL broke ground on a new battery manufacturing plant in Thuringia, Germany which will be known as Contemporary Amperex Technology Thuringia GmbH (CATT). The plant is on schedule to begin battery cell production before year’s end, and should create up to 1,500 jobs in the German state.

However, there is still some red tape and some dotted lines to sign before CATL can start making batteries in Germany. But with today’s news, the company is ever-closer.

CATL approved for battery cell production in Germany

The battery manufacturer announced this latest announcement in a press release out of Germany today, marking progress of its European expansion despite the woes of the pandemic. Matthias Zentgraf, CATL’s President for Europe, spoke to the 2nd partial approval in Germany:

CATT provides a fundamental impetus for the urgently needed energy transition, and we are glad to be the first company to receive approval to manufacture batteries ‘Made in Germany.’

In addition to being CATL’s first battery manufacturing plant outside of China, CATT will also be the first to arrive in Germany. German Ministers like Wolfgang Tiefensee hope this initial footprint can lead to further expansions in the state and more battery manufacturers calling Germany home:

For Thuringia, CATT is one of the most important industrial investments in recent decades. At the same time, the project could be the initial spark for the emergence of a ‘Battery Valley Thuringia,’ as the first batch of CATL’s supplier companies have settled around the area.

The initial CATT footprint will consist of two buildings – G1, an existing building CATL purchased from another company where battery cells are assembled into modules, and G2 – a new plant built by CATT where the cells will be produced. The latest approval from the press release pertains to a successful permit issued for the cell production of G2.

To further promote sustainability, the CATT plant will generate a portion of its power from solar panels on its roof. CATL shared that it will invest a total of 1.8 billion euro (~$1.96 billion) in the German plant, with a goal to eventually achieve 14 GWh of annual battery capacity and provide over 2,000 jobs.

CATL’s battery cell production in Germany is expected to begin before the end of 2022.",https://electrek.co/2022/04/06/catls-battery-plant-in-germany-its-first-outside-of-china-receives-production-approval-for-8-gwh-per-year/
