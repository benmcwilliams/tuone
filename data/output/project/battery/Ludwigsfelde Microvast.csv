Microvast completes battery factory in Brandenburg,2020-07-03 00:00:00,"After a three-month construction period, battery manufacturer Microvast celebrated the topping-out ceremony of its new European headquarters and the production building for Li-ion battery systems in Ludwigsfelde.

Microvast plans to inaugurate its first production line in March 2021 and start supplying battery modules and battery packs to its customers in Europe. “Especially in these challenging times, we are very pleased with the progress of construction,” says Sascha Kelterborn, who is a member of the board of directors of Microvast, Inc. and managing director of Microvast GmbH.

At the Battery Systems plant, Microvast intends to assemble cells produced by its Chinese sister company Microvast Power Systems in China. Initially, the production capacity is to be 1.5 GWh per year, later Ludwigsfelde is to be expanded to up to 6 GWh. Then up to 250 jobs will be created. The company, which was founded in Texas in 2006, has invested around 50 million euros in the first expansion stage, according to its own statements.

For Ludwigsfelde as the location for the European headquarters with the administration, research and development and the attached production building, the “excellent transport connections to major roads and the public transport network in the Berlin-Brandenburg region” played a special role. According to Microvast, this will make access to the metropolitan region and thus to cooperation and the exchange of know-how with research and educational institutions in the entire region easier. Ludwigsfelde is home to, among other things, a Mercedes-Benz Vans plant, as well as logistics centers of Volkswagen and Siemens.

Battery manufacturer Microvast commences production in Germany,2021-02-05 08:00:27+00:00,"While a lot of European eyes have been on Tesla’s Berlin Gigafactory, other companies have been quietly making their own plans. Battery manufacturer Microvast has opened its new European headquarters in Ludwigsfelde, Germany with plans to produce 500,000 battery modules.

Microvast, founded in 2006, makes batteries for commercial vehicles such as taxis and buses, as well as speciality transportation including mining trucks and port equipment.

In many markets, Microvast supplies lithium-ion battery components, instead of complete packs, to passenger carmakers. Their products are also used in data centres and consumer electronic devices.

While the new premises won’t be running at full capacity due to COVID-19, it is expected that up to 1.5 GWh of battery modules will be manufactured along a 100-meter-long production line at the 36,000-square-meter site. At the final stage, the factory will be able to accommodate 250 employees and generate an output of up to 6 GWh.

Microvast said it had invested approximately 50 million euros in the project so far, and 250 jobs will be created.

The company initially plans an annual production of about 300,000 to 500,000 battery modules for 10,000 to 15,000 electric vehicles. In the final expansion phase, battery systems will be delivered for about 50,000 to 75,000 vehicles per year.

Sascha Kelterborn, Senior VP Sales & Marketing Western Globe, Microvast, Inc., said: “Anyone who has ever engaged in corporate relocation and the setup of a production facility would know how challenging these tasks are even in normal times.

“Our employees and service partners have done truly an exceptional job under the current pandemic circumstances. I am very grateful for their hard work.”

At the end of last year, it was awarded a contract by the U.S. Advanced Battery Consortium to develop low-cost and fast-charge batteries for electric vehicle applications. Just earlier this week it announced that it will go public via a merger with Tuscan Holdings Corp. in a deal that values the combined company at £2 billion.
