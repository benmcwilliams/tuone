Volkswagen Group Announces €3 Billion Battery Gigafactory In Spain,2022-05-06,"The Volkswagen Group and SEAT announced that together with partners in the Future: Fast Forward project (total of 62 companies), it will invest €10 billion ($10.6 billion) to make Spain a European hub for electric mobility.

Part of the amount, which is described as the single largest industrial investment in Spain's history, is expected to come from the Strategic Project for Economic Recovery and Transformation program (PERTE), but the application must first be successfully accepted by the government.

Solar-powered battery gigafactory

One of the main parts of the entire project will be a new €3 billion ($3.2 billion) lithium-ion battery gigafactory in Sagunt near Valencia, which will supply battery cells to local EV plants (in Martorell and Pamplona).

The gigafactory in Spain (confirmed in 2021) will be Volkswagen's third after the one in Sweden (with Northvolt) and one in Germany. Three others will be announced at a later point.

Just like the other two, the plant in Sagunt will have a manufacturing capacity of 40 GWh/year. The construction is set to start in Q1 2023, while production is expected to start in 2026.

The Volkswagen Group intends to build a total of six 40 GWh battery gigafactories in Europe to secure up to 240 GWh of locally produced batteries by 2030.

According to Thomas Schmall, Member of the Board of Management of Volkswagen AG, Chief Technology Officer and Chairman of the Board of SEAT S.A., the PERTE funds will be essential for the investment:

The first milestone must be the positive outcome of the PERTE submission and the finalisation of the permits: “We will build the battery Gigafactory with an investment of more than 3 billion euros, but the PERTE funds are essential if we are to realise our ambition of turning Spain into a European hub for electric vehicles”,

The battery plant is promised to be powered by electricity from renewable sources. A major agreement with Iberdrola will result in a new photovoltaic plant (250 hectares), located less than 10 km (6 miles) from the battery factory. According to the press release, in the first phase, it will provide 20% of the gigafactory's total energy.

Envision Group to lead development of battery gigafactory in Extremadura,,"The Envision Group has presented plans for the production of electric vehicle batteries, and for which it has applied for funding from the Strategic Projects for Economic Recovery and Transformation for Electric and Connected Vehicles (PERTE VEC). The Chinese company heads a consortium of twelve companies which will be established in nine autonomous communities.

Extremadura will however be the nerve centre of the Venergy+ project. Envision will construct a battery gigafactory in Navalmoral de la Mata (Cáceres). The decision was made after several months of negotiations with the Spanish Government and with the support of the Regional Government of Extremadura, which has provided 200 hectares of land for development.



Promoting electric mobility

Venergy+ is not just a battery manufacturing project. Its aim is to generate an integrated ecosystem for promoting electric mobility. As well as the Asian company, which has ten battery factories in Japan, the US, the United Kingdom, China and France, the role of Acciona stands out among its partners, being responsible for the solar power plant that will be built alongside the gigafatory to supply clean energy.



The twelve partners will launch sixteen primary projects in total, ranging from battery production and renewable energy supply to the development of digital solutions. Together with the Envision Group, Venergy+ is made up of Acciona Generación Renovables, Acciona Silence, Teknia, the Galicia Automotive Technology Centre (CTAG), Aresar, Liux, Qalma, Glavista, Cable Energía and Kapture.IO.



Zero emission factory

The planned investment to launch Venergy+ is one billion euros. The star of the project is the construction of the battery gigafactory at Navalmoral de la Mata, which involves an investment of 900 million euros, and creating employment for around 3,000 people from 2025. This will be a zero emission factory because it will be powered by the on-site solar power plant to be installed by Acciona in three phases of 10 GW each, until reaching its planned target of 30 GW by 2030.



The cells, modules and high-performance battery packs produced at this gigafactory will be integrated into the different electrical platforms by using a removable battery system and adapted to models ranging from vans and heavy trucks to a new electric vehicle for last mile delivery, three modular electric vehicles and a light, electric two-wheel vehicle.



R&D collaboration

As well as promoting decarbonisation, this project contributes to the industrial renewal of the automotive sector in Spain, Europe’s second largest vehicle producer. It also encourages collaborative R&D across the entire battery life cycle, from storage to reuse, with smart charging and closed loop recycling.



According to the president of the Envision Group in Spain, José Domínguez Abascal, “Envision is very grateful to the Government of Spain and the Regional Government of Extremadura for the level of support they have shown to get us to this important point. We welcome this enduring strategic partnership and our shared ambition and cooperation, which will continue as we develop this and other projects together.”



Thousands of green jobs

Regarding the establishment of the consortium, Domínguez Abascal explained, “We are connecting large traditional companies with SMEs and start-ups, each of which make a unique contribution to the decarbonisation, growth and renewal of Spain and generate thousands of high-value green jobs for the future.”

Third Volkswagen Gigafactory To Be Built In Spain,2021-07-14,"By the way of announcing the NEW AUTO strategy through 2030, the Volkswagen Group has revealed also a third potential gigafactory investment in Europe.

The company would like to establish (together with partners) a total of six lithium-ion battery cell plants in Europe with a total output of about 240 GWh annually, which means 40 GWh per plant on average.

After a project in Skellefteå, Sweden (with Northvolt) and in Salzgitter, Germany (with Gotion High-Tech), it's time for Spain, where a new battery gigafactory would support planned local electric car production (mostly by SEAT/Cupra).

The project is not yet confirmed, but the Volkswagen Group together with an undisclosed partner would like to reach an output of 40 GWh by the end of 2030.

""As a third location, Volkswagen Group intends to make Spain a strategic pillar of its electric campaign and is considering to establish the entire value chain of electric cars in that country. As part of a larger transformation program, the localization would secure supply for the planned BEV production in Spain. Volkswagen Group verifies the option for a giga factory together with a strategic partner. In its final expansion stage at the end of the decade, the plant is intended to have a yearly capacity of 40 GWh hours.""

One more interesting thing is that the Volkswagen Group will launch in Spain a new family of small electric cars (Volkswagen's triplet successors, we guess) starting in 2025. Those electric cars will also use batteries from the new gigafactory.",https://insideevs.com/news/520118/third-volkswagen-battery-gigafactory-spain/

Spain to invest €4.3bn in EV and battery manufacturing,2021-07-12 00:00:00,"According to Pedro Sanchez, Spain's prime minister, the public plan will encompass the entire production chain. Grants will be given to companies with the goal of building the country's first battery plant and boosting manufacturing of EVs.

""It is important for Spain to react and to anticipate this transformation in Europe's automotive sector,"" said Sanchez. He added that government estimates found the private sector could contribute a further €19.7bn to the initiative between 2021 and 2023.

Few industrial bidders have publicly stated their intent to seek a helping of the funds, although Volkswagen's Spanish brand SEAT and energy company Iberdrola have teamed up to work on a bid as an alliance. Their involvement would fit within a wider project they are planning with Volkswagen which covers all aspects of EV production, from mining to battery production and the manufacturing of a finished vehicle at SEAT's assembly plant near Barcelona. The alliance plans to promote electrification based on renewables in Spain and beyond, including through the roll-out of a network of public fast and ultra-fast charging points.

With the new investment (part of a larger €13bn package directed towards sustainable mobility), Sanchez expects the sector's contribution to Spain's economic output to reach 15 per cent by 2030, from around 10 per cent at present. The government projects the creation of up to 140,000 new jobs and a boost to the national economy of between 1 to 1.7 per cent.

It aims for the number of new EVs registered in the country to reach 250,000 in 2023 - an enormous jump from the 18,000 registered in 2020. It hopes that a government-backed initiative to encourage the purchase of greener cars and expansion of charging infrastructure will encourage drivers to go electric.

Spain will receive around €70bn in grants until 2026 to help revive its economy. The country has been hit hard by the Covid-19 crisis, suffering more than 80,000 deaths from almost four million cases, and a severe hit to its tourism and hospitality sectors. Consequently, it will be one of the main beneficiaries of a €750bn EU recovery scheme.

Spain is already Europe's second-largest auto producer, following Germany, and the world's eighth largest. The country is home to more than a dozen car factories owned by Daimler AG, Ford, Opel, Nissan, Renault and many others.

As governments push towards the phase-out of combustion engines and the automotive industry adjusts to the shift towards EVs, Spain is racing against its neighbours Germany and France to overhaul supply chains and retool its facilities for the production of EV parts. A planned Tesla 'Gigafactory' near Berlin – which was intended to open on 1 July – is facing delays due to regulatory hurdles and some environmental opposition to the project.",https://eandt.theiet.org/2021/07/12/spain-invest-eu43bn-ev-and-battery-manufacturing

It is important for Spain to react and to anticipate this transformation in Europe’s automotive sector.

Adding the private sector could contribute a further 19.7 billion euros to the initiative from 2021 to 2023, according to government estimates.

After Germany, Spain is Europe’s second-largest auto producer and the world’s eighth biggest.

Spain to Invest $5,1 Bln in Battery Electric Vehicle Production

As the industry confronts a tectonic shift towards electric vehicles and greater technological integration, Spain is racing against Germany and France to overhaul supply chains and retool its manufacturing bases.

With the new investment, part of a 13-billion euro package earmarked for sustainable mobility, Sanchez expects the sector’s contribution to economic output to reach 15% by 2030, from around 10% now.

The programme could spur the creation of up to 140,000 new jobs and boost the national economy by 1%-1.7%, the government projects.

It aims for the number of new electric vehicles registered to reach 250,000 in 2023, a big jump from the 18,000 registered in 2020, thanks to government-sponsored initiatives to buy cleaner cars and expand charging stations.

As one of the main beneficiaries of a 750 billion euro EU recovery scheme, Spain will get around 70 billion euros in grants until 2026 to help revive its economy, which has been hit hard by the COVID-19 crisis.

While few private sector bidders have publicly emerged to seek a slice of the funds, Volkswagen’s Spanish brand SEAT and utility Iberdrola have formed an alliance to work on a bid.

Their involvement would fit within a wider project they are planning, covering all elements of electric vehicle production from mining to battery production to the manufacturing of a finished vehicle at SEAT’s assembly plant outside Barcelona.

Highlights:

Mostly financed by European Union recovery funds

Autos seen accounting for 15% of economic output by 2030

EU approves Spanish subsidy programme for EV batteries,2023-05-15 00:00:00,"The EU Commission has approved an €837 million Spanish government programme to support the production of batteries for electric vehicles under EU state aid rules. The programme is open to battery manufacturers and essential components or related raw materials suppliers.

The support will be provided in the form of direct grants and loans. The maximum amount of aid per beneficiary is €300 million for investments in the production of batteries, €100 million for essential battery components or €25 million for investments in the extraction of raw materials. The aid must be granted by 31 December 2025.

“This €837 million Spanish scheme to support production of batteries is an important step in the transition to a net zero economy, while protecting the level playing field in the single market and in line with cohesion objectives”, says Margrethe Vestager, Executive Vice-President in charge of competition policy.

The approval paves the way for the second call of the so-called PERTE VEC – a funding programme for electric and connected vehicles projects considered strategic for economic recovery and transformation. As reported, Spain’s government intends to launch two new tenders for the production of electric vehicles and batteries in July 2023.

Volkswagen received almost half of the available funds in the first funding round for measures such as the electrification of the factories in Seat Martorell and Pamplona, as well as the creation of a battery ecosystem for electric cars in Spain. That includes the battery factory near Valencia. And the Group says it would submit a new application to manufacture additional EVs in Spain. Last year, VW Group announced that it will invest a total of €10 billion in elctric mobility projects in Spain. Other carmakers, such as Renault and Ford, are also considering applying for the funding.

According to Brussels, the aid scheme is in line with the Temporary Crisis and Transition Framework. The latter had been put in place during the pandemic and was extended due to the consequences of the war in Ukraine.

“The Commission concluded that the Spanish scheme is necessary, appropriate and proportionate to accelerate the green transition and facilitate the development of certain economic activities, which are of importance for the implementation of the Green Deal Industrial Plan, in line with Article 107(3)(c) TFEU and the conditions set out in the Temporary Crisis and Transition Framework”, it says in the EU Commission’s statement. “On this basis, the Commission approved the aid measure under EU State aid rules.”
