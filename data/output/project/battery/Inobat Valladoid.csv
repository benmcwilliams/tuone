In addition to the Valladolid site in Spain, InoBat is considering other strategic sites in the United Kingdom for its Western European gigafactory

InoBat plans to make a decision on the location for its Western European gigafactory before the end of the year

Bratislava, 19 October 2022: InoBat Auto (“InoBat” or “the Company”), the European pioneer of premium electric vehicle battery R&D, engineering, production and recycling, today announces that it has signed protocols and declarations of intent with the Spanish authorities for the construction of a new production facility in Valladolid, Spain.

While the declaration of intent is not a finalised agreement and other locations remain under consideration, Valladolid’s wealth of talent, access to renewable energy, proximity to other OEMs and strong transport links make it a very attractive location for InoBat’s next facility.

The signing of protocols and declarations of intent with Valladolid City Council, Junta de Castilla y León, and the Ministry of Industry will ensure that, if Spain is selected, InoBat will have the necessary permits and governmental support to progress the project at pace.

This signing presents a significant opportunity for InoBat’s expansion and a key next step in the company’s plans to create a network of EV battery production plants across the globe. When the decision on InoBat’s gigafactory location in Western Europe is finalised, this facility will complement InoBat’s current plant in Voderady, Slovakia and recently announced site in Indiana, USA. All these locations, both confirmed and under consideration, are attractive due to key characteristics such as their access to renewable energy, future customers, and skilled labour.

Marian Boček, InoBat Auto Chief Executive Officer,“I am incredibly grateful to the Spanish authorities, both at regional and national level, for their support for InoBat’s next stage of growth. Valladolid is an ideal prospective location for our next facility – it is the beating heart of Spain’s automotive and engineering sectors and has extremely competitive access to suppliers, customers and, most importantly, EV talent. People will always be our most important asset and proximity to Europe’s leading engineers, chemists and technologists will be key in deciding the location of our next site. I’m incredibly pleased with how far InoBat has progressed in three short years and our next site will be a significant milestone in our development as we continue on our exciting journey towards a net zero future.”

"InoBat Auto and Ideanomics reveal plans to build R&D and battery production facilities in Indiana, USA, supported by the State of Indiana",2023-11-15,"InoBat Auto, Ideanomics, and the State of Indiana declare ambitious EV electrification plans for the North American market.

Within their strategic partnership, InoBat Auto and Ideanomics intend to:

Open a new battery module and pack R&D and a prototype-volume production facility.



Construct a full commercial-scale battery module and pack assembly plant.

InoBat is also exploring the potential construction of a cell manufacturing plant in line with future offtake agreements.

The State of Indiana was chosen as a prime location for investment due to its high concentration of OEMs, suitable business conditions for industrial projects and support from the State.

Listed plans follow up on Ideanomics' strategic investment into InoBat Auto from January 2022 to secure future battery supply and commercialize standard and tailor-made battery packs for the U.S. market.

INDIANAPOLIS, June 23, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- InoBat Auto, the European pioneering supplier of premium batteries for electric vehicles, in cooperation with Ideanomics, a global company focused on accelerating the adoption of commercial electric vehicles (EV), plans to embark upon a phased investment project based in Indiana, USA, in three stages. First, to open a new R&D and production facility for battery module and pack assembly with an initial annual production capacity of 100 MWh. Both parties then aim to construct a full commercial-scale battery module and pack assembly plant with an initial 2-3 GWh yearly production capacity. The first two phases would be supplied by cells from InoBat Auto's European facilities. Depending on sufficient and bankable offtake agreements, InoBat Auto is also exploring the option to construct a tailor-made battery cell production facility with an initial 4 GWh annual capacity.

Marian Boček, InoBat Auto Chief Executive Officer, commented, ""I am incredibly excited to announce our plans for the new module and pack R&D and production facility in Indiana, exemplifying the valuable synergies and opportunities that our partnership with Ideanomics offers.

InoBat to build battery factory in Valladolid,2022-10-20 00:00:00,"InoBat Auto has signed a letter of intent with Spanish authorities to build a factory in Valladolid. At the same time, however, the Slovakian battery manufacturer itself relativises the significance of the document by affirming that other locations in Western Europe are still in the running.

Already in spring, InoBat had announced that it would build its third plant for electric car batteries in Western Europe and that it would decide on a location by the end of the year. The two other factories are a pilot plant with 100 MWh that has been put into operation in the meantime and a planned production facility with 10 GWh in Slovakia.

Despite the declaration of intent, InoBat apparently does not want to commit itself to Spain. The company emphasises that the signed document is not yet a firm agreement and that sites in the UK are still being considered for the factory. The signing of the letters of intent is intended to ensure that if Spain is selected, InoBat will have the necessary permits and government support to move the project forward quickly. InoBat Auto plans to make a final decision on the location of its battery factory in Western Europe later this year.

In the summer, the Slovaks had also announced that they wanted to examine battery assembly and cell production in the USA. Together with the US company Ideanomics, which specialises in e-commercial vehicles, InoBat says it is planning a three-stage project for the development and production of batteries in the US state of Indiana.

InoBat’s business model is based on quickly developing customised battery solutions for customer vehicles. This is currently being done on the basis of the company’s first generation of battery cells. This is an NCM622 pouch cell. Compared to a benchmark cell from Asia, it is said to be able to charge from five to 80 per cent 25 per cent faster, have a 20 per cent longer service life and offer 28 per cent better capacity retention at -20 degrees Celsius.
