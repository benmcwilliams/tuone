SVOLT confirms 2nd battery cell plant in Germany,2022-09-10 00:00:00,"SVOLT has confirmed building another cell factory for the European battery industry in Germany. The new site at Lauchhammer, Brandenburg, is a former wind turbine plant owned by Vestas. The company aims to repurpose it fast, by early 2025.

This is to make up for the delays SVOLT is now facing in Saarland. The Chinese company has been planning to produce battery cells in central Europe for some time and had confirmed factories in the German state of Saarland in November 2020. SVOLT aims to make cells near the town of Überherrn, close to a battery assembly in Heusweiler, also Saarland. However, the new plans in Brandenburg come on the back of said delays at the Saarland sites. We will come to these later.

Yet there are other reasons for Lauchhammer. Brandenburg, the state that surrounds Berlin, lies along the region’s supply chain and battery life cycle. There is, for example, the chemical company BASF which entered a partnership with SVOLT for battery materials and recycling at the end of 2021. BASF is currently building a cathode material factory, including a recycling pilot plant, in Schwarzheide, less than 7 kilometres from Lauchhammer.

SVOLT is planning to start production in Brandenburg in early 2025, Maxim Hantsch-Kramskoj, VP of Sales & Marketing of SVOLT Europe, told journalists. The company targets an initial capacity of 16 GWh.

That sounds like construction will quick (and rushed). The former Vestas site is a so-called brownfield project. SVOLT says it took over the plant, including buildings and infrastructure, from the previous owner at the end of August and will now “repurpose the majority of the existing halls”. However, rebuilding measures and extension works will also be necessary and realised in the near future, so SVOLT. The company adds that it was developing a master plan including a detailed schedule for all modernisation and building measures.

SVOLT sites in Saarland facing delays

At the same time, the construction of the Saarland sites will take much longer than planned. According to the Saarbrücker Zeitung paper, Kramskoy does not expect SVOLT to produce battery cells in Überherrn before 2027 – that is four years later than initially announced.

Even though Heusweiler builds on an existing building like Brandenburg, there would also be delays at this second Saarland site for the assembly of modules and packs, the manager said. Production was supposed to start in the middle of this year with parts from other SVOLT plants. Now the company says it will only begin assembly by February 2024.

Hantsch-Kramskoj did not detail the reasons for the delay but pointed to the project being “very complex”. Following experts, they would now reach master planning. The Saarland sites would get the time they require, he said.

SVOLT has to deliver, first from Brandenburg

Still, SVOLT has to deliver another driver for selecting the Lauchhammer site reasonably quickly. So far, PSA is confirmed as a customer and signed an option for 7 GWh as reported.

Kai-Uwe Wollenhaupt, President of SVOLT Europe & VP of SVOLT Energy Technology, said he was happy that they were able to conclude the conversations with Vestas timely and take over the site.

Mirko Buhr, Mayor of the City of Lauchhammer, also went on to “explicitly thank all those involved for their dedicated efforts to bring a successor company to the former Vestas site as swiftly as possible.”

The site offers 255,000 square metres of space, and SVOLT has the right of first refusal on an adjacent free area of another 71,000 sqm.

Hantsch-Kramskoj referred to the project as a “gigafactory” when speaking to the local press. Even if put in Tesla-speak, the new factory won’t compare to the Tesla plant in Grünheide, about 150 kilometres away.

As for synergies between the plants in Brandenburg and Saarland, SVOLT expects to utilise battery cells produced in Lauchhammer at the future assembly site in Heusweiler. At least until the Saarland cell factory comes online. SVOLT aims to produce between 22 and 32 Gwh, double the 16 GWh in Brandenburg. That is batteries for about 300,000 to 500,000 e-vehicles per year.

SVOLT has not disclosed which cells may be made in Brandenburg (and Saarland). However, the company has pushed cobalt-free battery cells since July 2019. These have undergone testing for at least two years now.

Plus, the battery maker that came out of Great Wall Motors reportedly produced a prototype batch of 20 Ah cells with a solid electrolyte based on sulphide only a few weeks ago in China. The prototype solid-state cells have an energy density of 350-400 Wh/kg. This is in line with SVOLT’s earlier tests, and the result promises a range of over 1,000 kilometres for electric cars in future.

SVOLT signs lease for battery factory in Germany,2022-12-12 00:00:00,"The Chinese battery manufacturer SVOLT has signed the lease for its future factory for the assembly of modules and packs at the Saarland site in Heusweiler. However, there is no mention of the future of the cell factory also planned in Saarland.

SVOLT itself says that the 15-year lease agreement underpins its long-term plans in Saarland. Parallel to the lease agreement, the company has also secured a possible right of first refusal.

The first part of the building (Production 1) is scheduled to go into use in April 2023, with the other parts of the building to follow in stages. The final completion is contractually agreed by mid-2024. SVOLT employees have already moved into the new administration building in Heusweiler.

In November 2020, SVOLT announced two projects in Saarland – on the one hand, the assembly of battery cells into modules and packs and, on the other hand, the headline-grabbing establishment of a 24 GWh cell factory in Überherrn. The statement at the time: in the former laminate park in Heusweiler – about 30 kilometres from Überherrn – operations were to start in mid-2022, in the cell factory at the end of 2023.

Cell production delayed in Germany

While according to the current announcement the delay for the assembly in Heusweiler will be less than one year, it is different for the cell factory: In September 2022 SVOLT had announced the construction of another battery factory in Brandenburg (planned production start is early 2025). In the course of this, it also became known that the construction of the cell factory in Saarland will be significantly delayed. Maxim Hantsch-Kramskoj, Vice President Sales & Marketing of SVOLT Europe, stated at the time that he did not expect cell production in Überherrn before 2027.

The assembly in Heusweiler will therefore not be carried out with locally manufactured cells, and a supply of battery cells from Lauchhammer in Brandenburg will also not be possible until 2025. Instead, cells from the Chinese SVOLT plants will probably be assembled into modules and packs there.

The plant in Heusweiler in the former ‘Laminate Park’ was converted by the Goldbeck company as a general contractor on behalf of the Batteriefabrik Heusweiler (PBH) project company. PBH is itself a spin-off of SHS-Strukturholding Saar. The aim is to continue to use the existing buildings on the site in the best possible way in terms of sustainability and to keep the conversion measures to a minimum. Thus, the centrally located building complex with a total area of around 23,000 square metres and the administration building will be retained. Some areas have been deconstructed to make room for new buildings with about 13,000 square metres as well as necessary logistics areas and outdoor facilities.

“With the signing of the lease agreement, we are underpinning our long-term plans in Saarland, which are a key element of SVOLT’s European expansion strategy,” says Kai-Uwe Wollenhaupt, President SVOLT Europe & Vice President SVOLT Energy Technology. “The plant in Heusweiler will be the first location in Europe to directly supply our customers with battery packs and modules. I would like to thank all the partners involved and am particularly pleased that the first employees have already been able to move into the office buildings in Eiweiler.”

Anke Rehlinger, Minister-President of the German state of Saarland, added: “Preserving existing jobs and creating new ones: That is the primary goal of the state government. The establishment of SVOLT will bring many new jobs and is a great opportunity for Saarland to play in the premier league of electromobility.”

SVOLT Lands Its Second Overseas Factory in Germany as It Sprints Towards 600GWh Capacity Target,2017-06-08,"As the global NEV market maintains fast-pace growth, Chinese battery suppliers have begun overseas expansions in order to round out their development strategies and gain more market share. After CATL had announced on September 5 that its second factory in Europe will land in Hungary and entail an investment of CNY 50.9 billion, SVOLT confirmed on September 9 that its second overseas factory will be located in Germany.

SVOLT already unveiled a plan to establish two production sites in Germany in 2020. The development of the first factory began in November of that year. Located in Heusweiler, Saarland, this plant is still being built and will be used to assemble battery packs once it is fully set up. As for the second factory, SVOLT said it will be located Lauchhammer, Brandenburg. The site for this plant was actually formerly used to manufacture wind turbines. SVOLT will transform the defunct facility buildings so that they will manufacture battery cells instead.

The decision to place the second factory in Brandenburg has to do with the formation of a local EV industry cluster in the recent years. BASF and many other companies that are involved in the supply chain for Li-ion batteries have all set up shops in the state. In 2021, SVOLT and BASF formed a strategic partnership in the fields of battery materials and battery recycling.

According to the company’s plan for Germany, the factory in Brandenburg will supply battery cells to the factory in Saarland, where the assembly and installation of EV battery packs will take place. SVOLT pointed out that both plants have a geographical advantage. They are thus able to serve European customers more effectively with respect to project implementation. The two plants will also enable SVOLT to rapidly scale up its production capacity in Europe.

Established in December 2016, SVOLT was originally a business unit under Great Wall Motor. It was formally separated from its parent and became an independently operated company in 2018. Due to the rapid growth of its EV battery business, SVOLT at the end of 2021 rolled out the target of attaining a global total production capacity of 600GWh per year by 2025.

Hence, SVOLT has been very aggressive with respect to capacity expansion. Earlier on, the company made plans to build battery production bases in the Yangtze Delta, South China, and West China. Now, it set sights on Europe. The latest project in Brandenburg represents another big step forward in its global expansion.

Looking at other suppliers for EV batteries, CATL has also recently unveiled its plan for a second factory in Europe. On September 5, CATL and the government of Debrecen, which is the second largest city in Hungary, inked a land pre-purchasing agreement. With this deal, CATL has officially initiated the construction of its second battery factory in Europe. CATL’s first factory in the region is in the German state of Thuringia. Its construction phase began in 2019, and its operation phase is scheduled to commence before the end of this year. As for the second factory, it will be located in the Debrecen Industrial Park, and its construction phase will begin this year. CATL said the total investment in the second factory will reach around CNY 50.9 billion (EUR 7.34 billion). Spanning an area of 221 hectares, the second factory will have a production capacity of 100GWh per year. Carmakers including BMW will be among the customers first served by this plant.

Market intelligence firm TrendForce points out that in addition to CATL and SVOLT, many other Chinese battery suppliers have made plans to build overseas factories. EVE will build a factory for manufacturing cylindrical batteries in Hungary. Envision AESC will build a factory for manufacturing EV batteries in Spain. BYD, too, is raising funds to set up its first overseas battery production plant, which is intended to be located in Europe. Likewise, CALB, Gotion High-Tech, Farasis Energy, and Sunwoda have either launched or considering overseas manufacturing projects.

Besides Europe, North America is also getting increasing attention from Chinese battery suppliers. Envision AESC has presented a plan for a gigafactory in the US. Gotion High-Tech is reported to be in discussion to set up a joint venture through which it will build a factory in the US. CATL previously expressed interest in building a factory in Kentucky, but this project has been postponed.

There are several factors motivating Chinese battery suppliers to set up production capacity outside their home country. First, the rapid growth of the global NEV market has been beneficial for Chinese battery suppliers and is encouraging them to pursue overseas expansions in order to improve their international competitiveness. Moreover, having a presence in other countries will generate more brand recognition and thereby create opportunities for gaining more market share. Lastly, Chinese battery suppliers want to have battery production sites near their major overseas clients. This will lower the cost of transporting products and put suppliers in a more proactive position in contract negotiations and capturing orders.

While building overseas factories could result in gaining a greater share of the global market, TrendForce notes that are there also risks, including unforeseen ones, with this approach. Investment cost, geopolitics, environmental regulations, industrial policies, and cultural differences are some of the many issues that Chinese battery suppliers need to consider when planning to set up shops in other countries.
