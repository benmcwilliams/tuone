The specified fuel consumption and emission data are determined in accordance with the measurement procedures prescribed by law. 1 January 2022, the WLTP test cycle completely replaced the NEDC test cycle and therefore no NEDC values are available for new type approved vehicles after that date. This information does not refer to a single vehicle and is not part of the offer but is only intended for comparison between different types of vehicles. Additional equipment and accessories (additional components, tyre formats, etc.) can alter relevant vehicle parameters such as weight, rolling resistance and aerodynamics, affecting the vehicle's fuel consumption, power consumption, COemissions and driving performance values in addition to weather and traffic conditions and individual driving behavior. Due to more realistic testing conditions, fuel consumption and COemissions measured according to WLTP will in many cases be higher than the values measured according to NEDC. As a result, the taxation of vehicles may change accordingly as of 1 September 2018. For further information on the differences between WLTP and NEDC, please visit www.volkswagen.de/wltp .

Volkswagen kicks off $20B battery investment,2022-07-07 00:00:00,"Volkswagen Group broke ground Thursday at the first of six battery factories it expects to build in Europe, the official kickoff of a new battery business that will invest $20 billion through 2030 to become a global EV leader.

Volkswagen’s new company, called PowerCo, will be responsible for the automaker’s global battery business, managing the value chain from raw materials to recycling. The automaker expects that the factory in Salzgitter, Germany and the five others planned for Europe will cut its battery costs by half, a key competitive advantage as the global market for EVs intensifies.

The factories and new company are part of Volkswagen’s efforts to ramp up EV production worldwide. Earlier this week. the world’s second-largest automaker announced plans to grow its business in China with “some major investments” and a hiring spree at the Chinese office for CARIAD, Volkswagen’s in-house automotive software arm.

Volkswagen said battery cell production will begin in 2025 at the Salzgitter factory, which will serve as the standardized model for future factories, making it easier to replicate and scale. PowerCo will locate its second cell factory in Valencia, Spain and is considering expanding the model to North America. Locations for the four other European factories have not been announced.

PowerCo will manage Volkswagen Group’s international factory operations, develop cell technology, vertically integrate the value chain and supply the factories with machinery and equipment. The Salzgitter plant is expected to supply about 500,000 EVs. Together, the new factories planned for Europe could supply roughly 3 million EVs.

Volkswagen said PowerCo and partners will invest more than 20 billion EUR ($20.34 billion) by 2030 and employ up to 20,000 people in Europe. Additional projects include developing storage systems for the energy grid.

VW CEO Herbert Diess called the launch of the company a “strategic milestone.”

“Establishing our own cell factory is a mega-project in technical and economic terms,” Diess said in a statement. “It shows that we are bringing the leading-edge technology of the future to Germany.”",https://techcrunch.com/2022/07/07/volkswagen-breaks-ground-on-first-of-six-battery-factories/

Volkswagen starts building the first of six battery gigafactories,2022-07-07 14:20:39+00:00,"Volkswagen Group announced on Thursday that it is consolidating its battery development and production in a new project called Mission SalzGiga. The name refers to Salzgitter in Germany, where VW has built more than 63 million internal combustion engines—it has now broken ground on a massive new battery factory at the site, the first of six planned for Europe. Each plant should be able to accommodate an annual production capacity of 40 GWh, sufficient to power 500,000 electric vehicles.

To that end, the company has set up a new Salzgitter-based business unit called PowerCo that will cover all of the automaker's global battery activities. VW says it will require more than $20.4 billion (20 billion euros) in investment between now and 2030 but with an equal potential in revenue, plus the addition of 20,000 new jobs.

""In building our first in-house cell factory, we are consistently implementing our technology roadmap,"" said Thomas Schmall, VW board member in charge of technology. ""PowerCo will become a global battery player. The company's major strength will be vertical integration from raw materials and the cell right through to recycling. In future, we will handle all the relevant activities in-house and will gain a strategic competitive advantage in the race to take the lead in e-mobility.""

Cell production is scheduled to begin at the Salzgitter factory in 2025, and VW says it has already retrained 1,000 employees from making engines. It says the battery factory will add another 5,000 jobs over the next few years.

VW wants to scale up rapidly, so it has standardized the design of the battery factories, which will use green electricity to operate, incorporating the ability to move to closed-loop recycling once the supply of old EV batteries makes that possible. The Salzgitter site will also have facilities for battery research and development in addition to large-scale production and recycling.

The automaker is also moving to a standardized cell format, a prismatic cell first announced in 2021. Although the cell's size and shape are fixed, it has been designed to allow flexibility in terms of cell chemistries, and VW says that 80 percent of its EVs will adopt the unified prismatic cell.

VW says that by 2030, its European battery plants should give it an annual capacity of 240 GWh. In addition to Salzgitter, the company has already identified Valencia, Spain, as the site of the second battery factory and is also looking into building additional battery factories in the US. The company will start building ID.4 crossovers at its factory in Chattanooga, Tennessee, in July; the vehicles will use cells made in Georgia by SK Innovation (European-made ID.4s use LG cells).",https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/07/volkswagen-starts-building-the-first-of-six-battery-gigafactories/
