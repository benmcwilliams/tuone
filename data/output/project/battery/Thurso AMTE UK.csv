AMTE Power takes its UK battery plant to the next level with the Thurso+ Project – AMTE Power,,"Noting a surge of demand from customers for battery cells for electric vehicles, AMTE Power is scaling up its battery cell production facility in Scotland, identifying opportunities to boost manufacturing productivity, and supply battery cells to specialist vehicle manufacturers. These learnings will be applied to future development and roll-out of a significant new UK facility.

The UK Automotive battery supply chain has maintained significant strengths in the chemicals industry and developments of the next-generation anode and cathode technology. The AMTE Power Thurso facility has played a significant role in the upscaling of these technologies, from the lab to low production volumes. However, as the technologies find success there are limited opportunities to continue development and production within the UK.

HSSMI and AMTE Power conducted a Faraday-Battery-Challenge round 3 feasibility project to establish the validity of a UK based Gigafactory. This study provided the expected operational and capital costs for such a facility as well as an expected operational date of 2022. However, while the development of this facility is on-going, AMTE has seen a recent surge of demand from customers that cannot be currently met with the existing processes, equipment and scale of the current facility.

To address this challenge, the Thurso+ project aims to determine the feasibility of upscaling AMTE Power’s electrochemical battery cell production facility in Thurso and how it can best be aligned with their future Gigafactory. The Thurso+ project will aim to develop a productivity and investment roadmap which will be used to:

Identify and implement immediate opportunities for increasing productivity and efficiency through lean and flexible manufacturing principles.

Understand how the Thurso facility can best achieve technological parity in production methods to those of state-of-the-art Gigafactories.

This will facilitate further development of innovative and high-performance UK based products supporting the Automotive Industry. The project will increase the accessibility of cell supply for low volume specialist vehicle manufacturers who struggle with large OEMs buying up capacity.

The Thurso+ project is being submitted to Innovate UK’s competition: ATF: moving the UK automotive sector to zero emissions. The project will demonstrate innovation in the development of lean, flexible, and state of the art, high volume cell manufacturing capability in the UK of which there is currently a significant lack of. There is innovation in the adoption of high-volume manufacturing techniques and process within a small scale facility. This will reduce scale-up costs through minimising development and trials during each increase in production quantity. The project consortium is made up of AMTE Power, the cell manufacturer, and HSSMI, experts in high volume and scale-up manufacturing.",https://amtepower.com/amte-takes-its-uk-battery-plant-to-the-next-level-with-the-thurso-project/
Thurso: powering our growth plans – AMTE Power,,"At AMTE Power, we’re incredibly proud of our heritage at Thurso in northeast Scotland, and our facility there is set to play a central part in our ambitious growth plans.

The factory has been making cells for over 30 years and can trace its roots back to the birth of lithium-ion technology first patented in the UK. As the UK’s second largest battery cell manufacturing facility, Thurso has played an integral role in getting our business to the great position it’s in today. We’ve built up a strong, expert team and developed highly specialised products to meet the needs of the automotive and energy storage markets.

Now, as AMTE Power enters a new phase of production scale up to commercial volumes, we’re investing further in our Thurso site. Crucially we’re improving the site’s manufacturing capabilities to ramp up production of two of our core cells: Ultra Prime and Ultra Safe.

This investment comes off the back of strong customer interest in our products – we’re already fulfilling orders and shipping prototypes. By investing in our manufacturing capacity, we’ll be able to meet rising demand, while building the experience and supply chain needed for more orders in the future.

Ultra Prime is designed for use in some of the most difficult industrial environments, with a high energy density, high-temperature performance and low self-discharge. It will support the decarbonisation of sectors like construction, mining, oil and gas, and agriculture.

Ultra Safe on the other hand is designed for energy storage applications which are fundamental to maximising renewable power. The European battery storage market is expected to hit 300GWh by 2030, so ensuring the UK has a reliable supply of batteries will be essential to capitalise on this growth.

Our factory at Thurso may be at the furthest reaches of the UK, but it is at the heart of our business, underpinning our technology development and now driving forward the next stage of commercialisation. Thurso is part of the story of British battery making and we’re proud to be building on this to help take the industry to the next level.

Thurso battery maker to lead £5m electric vehicle project,2021-06-24 11:45:59,"A battery maker in Thurso is to be lead supplier in a £5million project to enable high volume manufacture of equipment for electric vehicles.

AMTE Power will focus on bringing two lithium-ion batteries to “automotive readiness” during the three-year, government-funded “Ultra” initiative.

The company said it will be working closely with well-known global vehicle manufacturers.

As one of four supply chain companies involved, AMTE has been awarded £2.3m by the UK Government’s Advanced Propulsion Centre (APC), which is part-funding the scheme.

The firm’s Ultra High Power and Ultra Energy cells will be sent to project partners for external validation and trials in their electric vehicle prototypes, with the key aim of ensuring they are ready for volume manufacture.

AMTE chief executive, Kevin Brundish, said: “We are delighted to have been chosen to lead this project.

“The APC selects companies who they believe will be key players in the UK’s electric vehicle supply chain, and funds projects that will take products into this high volume market.

Working closely with leading automotive manufacturers and supply chain companies is an ideal position to be in as we work towards volume production of our products.”

The APC is focused on supporting the UK automotive industry in the lead up to the electrification of the vehicle market in 2030.

The three other supply chain companies involved in the Ultra project are: electric drive system designer, Magtec; fast-charging equipment maker, Petalite; and precision metal supplier, Avocet.

Magtec is participating with the aim of proving the Ultra Energy cell performance in two of its commercial electric vehicles.

Leading manufacturers involved

Leading automotive manufacturers will be closely involved in the project as steering partners, providing guidance on technical and commercial requirements of AMTE’s batteries.

AMTE, which was formed in 2013, was floated on the London Stock Exchange (LSE) Alternative Investment Market (AIM) in March.

Shares in the company had risen 6.69%, to £2.55, by the close of trading on Thursday, following the announcement of its involvement in the project.

Last month, the firm, which is already the UK’s second largest producer of energy storage cells, announced plans to develop a “gigafactory” as a global race to meet demand for electrification intensifies.

Mr Brundish added: “Importantly, this project will not affect the existing commercialisation plans for these cells, as set out at the time of our IPO.

“It will instead be it will instead be complementary and focus on readiness to mass produce for our targeted automotive client base.”",https://www.pressandjournal.co.uk/fp/business/3261064/amte-electric-vehicles/
AMTE reveals plan to extend its Thurso battery factory,2022-03-10 17:00:35,"Battery-maker AMTE Power has secured planning permission to extend its factory in Thurso.

The London-listed company said it was benefiting from new opportunities, thanks to manufacturing “know-how” in its home town in Caithness.

Output from the site is increasing and AMTE now aims to “extend this site and capability”.

New tie-up for bringing electricity to some of world’s poorest communities

Announcing first-half results today, AMTE also revealed a new commercial tie-up for its Thurso-made sodium-ion batteries.

The company has teamed up with Midlands-based renewable energy and battery specialist AceOn to bring electricity to remote sub-Saharan African communities.

AceOn has placed an initial order for 1,000 of AMTE’s next generation batteries.

They will be at the heart of portable, solar energy-based power units helping to bring clean, affordable and sustainable power to some of the world’s poorest and most remote regions.

The power units are said to be “ideal for areas where the electricity infrastructure is not reliable or it is insufficient to meet local needs, such as parts of Africa, India and Australia”.

‘Gigafactory plan’

AMTE is developing its Ultra Safe batteries in Thurso, while simultaneously progressing plans for a new “gigafactory” elsewhere in the UK – Dundee has been mooted as a potential location.

The company released an image, alongside its half-year results, showing what the new plant may look like.

Chief executive Kevin Brundish said: “Our work with AceOn represents a further step in our commercialisation of differentiated cells that will power the energy transition.

“Sodium-ion has huge potential for application in energy storage where there is a need to dramatically scale-up production of safe, stable battery technology alongside the growth of renewables.

“The UK has long been a pioneer in new battery technology and partnerships like ours underpin the opportunity for the UK to be the driving force in the development of sodium-ion.”

Pre-tax losses for the six months to December 31 2021 widened to £2.65m, from £1.46m a year ago.

Revenue for the latest period came in at £815,174, up from £623,536 previously.

Shares in the Alternative Investment Market (AIM) firm fell nearly 5% to 88p following the results.

AMTE – which has traded since 1997 – joined the AIM last March, raising £13.7m, nearly twice its original goal of £7m.

Mr Brundish said: “A year on from listing we have used our proven cell manufacturing expertise to forge our clear pathway to full commercialisation as the market leader in advanced battery cells focusing on the huge global markets of energy storage and high-performance automotive sectors.

“We have invested in ongoing development, increased cell production rates, and developed commercial relationships and partnerships as well as refined our plans during the past six months. We anticipate that significant milestones will be achieved during 2022.

He added: “We are excited for the current year; we are pleased with our progress and expansion towards gigafactory production rates.

“We are in a strong position in the market, with a depth of operational expertise and management know-how to deliver on our plans.”",https://www.pressandjournal.co.uk/fp/business/local/4042310/amte-reveals-plan-to-extend-its-thurso-battery-factory/
AMTE Power set to expand Thurso battery production plant,2022-03-11 10:04:51+00:00,"AMTE Power has received planning permission to extend its Thurso production facility, upping the rate of batteries being built.

Its half-year financial statement saw turnover of £810,000 - up 31% on the 620,000 made during the same period the previous year - although losses before tax grew to £2.65m, from £1.46m the previous year.

Improved balance sheet strength of £6.26m cash or cash equivalents - up from just £22,000 - should underpin the company's investment phase.

AMTE's planned announcement of its Gigafactory site in 2022 should support a ramp up in production, to meet growing demand driven by the global energy transition.

Three potential sites have been identified in the UK, with engagement underway with local authorities and design development. A final decision on site selection is expected in 2022, with commercial production in 2025.

""As a result of refining product development, scale up, and increasing operational capacity, we expect reduced revenue and a moderate impact on loss before tax over the next two years,"" the statement noted.

The company's battery cell development continues at pace, with both the Ultra Energy (UE) cell and Ultra High Power (UHP) cell currently undergoing ""significant scale up and testing trials"" at the UK Battery Industrialisation Centre, where the UK Government has invested £130m into a high-rate cell production facility.

Trials using 'Gigascale production' equipment have achieved their goals and AMTE is looking ""to raise the bar further"".

Development and commercial partnerships are ""maturing to active commercial discussions"", with named development and steering committee partners including BMW, Arrival, QinetiQ and Faradion.

Also during the period, AMTE announced the launch of an Australian joint venture with InfraNomics. The company is set to licence its Ultra Storage cell to joint venture company Bardan Cells. The proposed factory has initial target of 200,000 cells per annum, with a plan to scale to 2GWh.

Negotiations with equipment suppliers is nearing completion, and site selection, equipment ordering and ground-breaking are all expected in 2022. Bardan's work is expected to underpin the UK Gigafactory build. The joint venture also gives AMTE access to Australia’s more mature renewables energy storage market.

AMTE chief executive Kevin Brundish said: ""A year on from listing we have used our proven cell manufacturing expertise to forge our clear pathway to full commercialisation as the market leader in advanced battery cells focusing on the huge global markets of energy storage and high-performance automotive sectors.

""We have invested in ongoing development, increased cell production rates, and developed commercial relationships and partnerships as well as refined our plans during the past six months.
