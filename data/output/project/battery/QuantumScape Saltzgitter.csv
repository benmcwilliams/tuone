QuantumScape (QS) Q3 2023: prototype solid-state test cells exceed performance targets,2023-10-26 00:00:00,"Following the close of Q3 2023, solid-state battery developer QuantumScape has updated the public to its progress the last three months, which includes some encouraging results. In addition to catching a peep at mockups of its production-intent QSE-5 cell design, QuantumScape’s prototype has done better than expected with one automotive OEM in particular. Are solid-state EVs closer than we imagined? QuantumScape says maybe, but it still has some work to do.

If you don’t know the name QuantumScape ($QS) by now, you should probably start educating yourself (don’t worry, we have plenty of previous coverage for you to study). The advanced battery technology company has been working for over a decade to develop scalable, energy-dense solid-state battery cells that can one day achieve cost parity with traditional lithium-ion cells popular in current EV models.

While there are plenty of competitors out there chasing a future powered by safer and more efficient solid-state cells, QuantumScape hit its own major breakthrough in 2020 by utilizing a proprietary ceramic separator. This technology led to single-layer prototype cell testing, followed by 10-layer cells, then 16-layer prototypes.

By Q2 of 2022, QuantumScape’s solid-state had expanded to 24 layers, setting the stage for vigorous internal testing and the beginning of a three-step journey (A, B, and C prototype cells) before entering automotive qualification and (hopefully) commercialized production.

In December of 2022, QuantumScape began delivering the first 24-layer A0 prototype cells to automotive partners to test themselves, and by Q1 of 2023, testing had been completed by at least one unnamed EV OEM.

At that same time, QuantumScape shared that its first commercial solid-state product will be an ~5 Ah cell called QSE-5 (seen above), which also began shipping to OEM partners as of Q2 2023. Now, QuantumScape has posted its Q3 2023 report, and A0 prototype testing has delivered results that were better than expected.

QuantumScape rolls in Q3, shares FlexFrame format

As previously mentioned, QuantumScape’s first planned commercial product will be a solid-state cell called the QSE-5, based upon the aforementioned A0 prototype cells. QS states that the cell consists of a unique format it calls FlexFrame, which combines the conventional pouch and prismatic cell designs in order to address the “uniaxial expansion of lithium metal as it plates and strips during charging and discharging.”

The battery developer shared that a primary goal for 2023 is to improve the packaging of its QSE-5 cells compared to the A0 prototypes, as the former will contain higher-loading cathodes than the former, sustaining higher current densities built with tighter margins, putting more stress on the cell.

For comparison, QuantumScape says the QSE-5 cells are designed to deliver a capacity around 5 amp-hours (Ah), while 2170 battery designs currently used by some of the top EV automakers offer an average capacity of around 4.5–5 Ah. In this case, QuantumScape sits on the cusp of performance parity if not better, using smaller, lighter, and safer cells.

Switching back to the A0 prototypes that will enable the production of the QSE-5 cells someday, QuantumScape provided further room for optimism in its Q3 2023 report. The company states that although its commercial target for its solid-state cells remains at 80% energy retention through 800 charge cycles, one prospective automotive customer found much better results testing the A0 cells.

Those labs completed over 1,000 full cycle equivalents and achieved over 95% discharge energy retention using test conditions of C/3 charge and C/2 discharge with QuantumScape’s standard temperature and pressure conditions, and 100% depth of discharge. In the Q3 report, QuantumScape patted itself on the back for this encouraging result, but isn’t shopping for yachts any time soon – there is still plenty of room for improvement. Per the company:

We emphasize that this is the best-performing cell and we have work to do on aspects such as reliability. Nonetheless, this is an exceptional result. We are not aware of any automotive-format lithium-metal battery that has shown such high discharge energy retention over a comparable cycle count, at room temperature and modest pressure, regardless of C-rate. We believe that no competing electrolyte — solid or liquid — has demonstrated sufficient stability with lithium metal to achieve this, and that this result sets a new high-water mark for lithium-metal battery performance.

Looking ahead, QuantumScape states that its work beyond Q3 2023 will remain focused on QSE-5 development, which could find much success in several applications serving all vehicles from passenger EVs, to commercial trucks, motorcycles, and even consumer electronics. In regard to electronics, QuantumScape’s Q3 report states that the company’s single-layer solid-state cells have now achieved between 1,500 to 2,000 cycles with approximately 80% discharge energy retention with zero externally applied pressure. For comparison, QS states that 500 to 1,000 charge-discharge cycles represents the key life cycle threshold for most consumer electronics applications.

On the manufacturing side, QuantumScape has completed equipment installation for its “Raptor” fast separator heat treatment process (3x as fast as previous processes) and remains on track to deploy the process by year’s end. It also continues to make progress in implementing its “Cobra” process to support the QSE-5 B0 prototype production in the future.

Financials look good as well. The Q3 report detailed $1.1 billion in liquidity as QuantumScape raised $300 million in gross proceeds the past three months. The company’s current forecast offers enough runway to continue solid-state cell development into 2026. Per QuantumScape:

Our focus for 2023 is simple: turn the corner from prototype to product. Our key milestones are all aimed at advancing product development to build a sufficient level of technical and manufacturing maturity to enable initial production of QSE-5. With just a few months remaining in the year, we are maintaining aggressive near-term schedules and remain focused on bringing a potentially disruptive first product to market in the near future.

But strategically, our mission is bigger than a series of near-term objectives. We have been pursuing a next-generation electric vehicle battery for over a decade, and with a mission as challenging and as important as this, long-term thinking is indispensable. Moreover, the market opportunity for our technology platform is massive, potentially in the hundreds of billions of dollars annually for decades to come.",https://electrek.co/2023/10/26/quantumscape-qs-q3-2023-prototype-solid-state-cells-exceed-targets/
QuantumScape considers cell production in Salzgitter,2021-05-16 00:00:00,"QuantumScape could produce solid-state batteries in the German city of Salzgitter with Volkswagen in the future. According to an agreement between the two companies, the location for the planned pilot plant with VW is to be determined this year.

According to the US battery specialist, Salzgitter is currently being considered for the pilot plant location. The plant, called QS-1, will initially have a capacity of 1 GWh, which will later be successively expanded to a total capacity of 21 GWh for series production.

Despite the announcement by its cooperation partner, Volkswagen says that no final decision has yet been made on the construction of a pilot plant for solid fuel cells in Salzgitter. “This technology of the future can only be built up in Germany with state support – because without such support Salzgitter has little chance in European and international comparison,” says a VW spokesperson. “The final decision on further steps towards a solid fuel cell pilot plant will be made in the fourth quarter at the latest.”

At QuantumScape, things sound much more optimistic. “Our goal has been to bring our solid-state lithium-metal batteries to market as soon as possible,” says Jagdeep Singh, CEO and co-founder of QuantumScape. “This joint venture brings together QuantumScape’s core battery technology with Volkswagen’s deep understanding of high-volume, high-quality production, and maximizes our ability to bring this technology into industrial production.”

Although the agreement was officially with Volkswagen Group of America, the fact that the Salzgitter site is being considered makes it clear that the group’s headquarters in Wolfsburg is the driver behind the cooperation.

Salzgitter is already a very important location for Wolfsburg’s battery plans: it is home to the pilot production facility for battery cells that will open in 2019. This project was initially driven forward with their battery partner Northvolt. After the Wolfsburg company announced at Power Day in March just passed that it would develop Salzgitter into one of the six European battery factories, it became clear that VW is now pushing ahead with the project alone. Salzgitter is also home to the pilot recycling plant for battery materials that opened in January 2021.

In February, QuantumScape announced the construction of a pilot plant called QS-0 in San José, California. At the end of March, QuantumScape announced in a stock offering that it would build a pilot plant with VW. A few weeks later, Volkswagen invested a further $100 million in the battery specialist, as QuantumScape’s cells had met contractually agreed requirements.",https://www.electrive.com/2021/05/16/quantumscape-considers-cell-production-in-salzgitter/

"3 Reasons to Buy QuantumScape Stock, and 1 Reason to Sell",2023-12-14,"electric vehicle EV car battery lithium ion installation

More than 200 years since the battery was invented, and over 100 years since first being commercialized on a large scale, battery technology is more important than ever. For these big developments taking place, thank the automotive industry (along with some nudging from various governments and organizations around the world, not to mention Tesla's financial success). Automakers are trying to make a pivot from internal combustion engines (ICE) to electric vehicles (EVs) powered by lithium-ion batteries.

But there are big technology problems that still need to be solved that could add fuel to the EV fire (not literally, since an EV fire is no bueno). Enter QuantumScape (NYSE: QS), which continues to plug away at its ""battery technology platform"" with key automaker partners.

2023 was a wild year for QuantumScape's stock. There are reasons for optimism, but also one big red flag investors need to be mindful of. The thesis surrounding investing in QuantumScape boils down to three primary reasons.

1. QuantumScape is now shipping batteries to automakers

QuantumScape is working on a solid-state lithium-metal battery platform. Lithium-metal is promising, as it is more energy dense, which should theoretically increase the driving range of an EV.

The company's work centers on replacing traditional lithium-ion battery anodes with pure lithium-metal (an anode is the half of a battery that releases electrons and provides electric current during battery discharge). The idea is that other material innovations in the cathode (the receiving half of the battery during discharge, and the half that sends electrons back to the anode during charging) can be paired with QuantumScape's anode and ceramic separator technology (the separator is the material between the anode and cathode) to provide automaker and other manufacturing partners with a higher-performance custom battery setup for their specific needs.

There has been excitement throughout 2023 as the company said it was shipping prototype battery cells (the ""A0"") to prospective customers for testing. There is one prospective customer engagement that could possibly lead to EV production featuring QuantumScape's first production-ready battery, the QSE-5, though this project is small in scope for now.

Story continues

2. The company hired an executive with manufacturing experience

Adding further to the belief that QuantumScape is reaching an important inflection point, the company hired Dr. Siva Sivaram over the summer of 2023 to head up tech research and manufacturing. Sivaram has extensive experience in the semiconductor industry, last serving at memory chipmaker Western Digital, and before that as an executive at SanDisk (acquired by Western Digital in 2016).

QuantumScape itself said the hiring was important as it flips from a research and development focus to a battery production focus. Much like semiconductor manufacturing, battery production is a complicated process that would benefit from having someone with extensive experience.

3. The EV market is still growing fast

Of course, there have been media reports in the second half of 2023 about the slowing EV market, which is being throttled by higher interest rates. Higher rates increase the cost of financing, making an expensive new EV model less attractive to consumers.

Despite the bad press about an industry slowdown, though, the EV market is indeed still growing. Top lithium producer Albemarle confirmed as much in its latest financial update, showing that global EV sales remain on pace to increase 40% compared to 2022.

If that's true, it could be good news for QuantumScape. A growing EV market means there could be no shortage of demand for its lithium-metal batteries once they are ready for commercialization.

One reason to sell QuantumScape stock

Setting aside the optimism surrounding this start-up, there's one big reason to view QuantumScape with a healthy dose of skepticism.

This time last year, I said two things needed to happen for QuantumScape stock to sustain a rally. It needed to start realizing revenue and the U.S. Federal Reserve's interest rate hikes needed to start coming down (higher interest rates lower the present value of a company, in addition to making financing more expensive). Neither has happened.

The lack of revenue in particular underscores the fact that QuantumScape is still just a start-up. Because it reports zero revenue, the business racks up significant quarterly losses -- $121 million in operating losses in Q3 2023, and $354 million in operating losses in the first nine months of 2023).

To keep its balance sheet liquid during the R&D phase of its existence, QuantumScape sold more shares this past summer to raise an additional $288 million in cash (it ended Q3 with $1.1 billion in cash and short-term investments and zero debt). However, stock sales dilute ownership for existing shareholders, further amplifying the downward pressure on the stock.

Until QuantumScape starts reporting actual sales, it will be hard to justify a sustained rally higher for the stock price. At this juncture, QuantumScape should still be considered a high-risk and only potentially high-reward investment. At best, for most investors, this stock should merely be part of a diversified basket of EV battery and lithium technology and bets.

"VW Invests $100M in QuantumScape, a Battery-Building Unicorn",2018-06-28,"Volkswagen Group just raised its stake in stealthy battery builder QuantumScape with a substantial $100 million bet. The world's automotive giants are in an expensive race for the lead in electric vehicles and this is just their most recent capital move.

QuantumScape was founded in 2010 as a Stanford University spinoff and was initially funded by ARPA-E for an ""all-electric battery."" That dubious idea was soon abandoned for a more traditional lithium metal solid-state approach. (""For battery nerds, 'solid-state' is synonymous with 'lithium metal anode,"" according to battery expert David Snydacker of Dosima Research.)

A few Silicon Valley publications have labeled QuantumScape a ""unicorn"" since it garnered a valuation of more than a billion dollars in its most recent funding round (according to PitchBook Data.) That's a heady valuation for a company still deep in its development phase and without significant revenue. (Theranos had a valuation of $9 billion at one point.)

Other investors in QuantumScape include Kleiner Perkins, Prelude Ventures, Lightspeed Venture Partners, Capricorn Investment Group, and Khosla Ventures. Optical networking aficionados will remember QuantumScape's CEO Jagdeep Singh as the very successful founder of Lightera and Infinera.

Dipender Saluja, managing director at Capricorn Investment Group is on QuantumScape's board, as is VW's Axel Heinrich. Bruce Sohn, former president of First Solar once served as president of QuantumScape.

Lithium metal anodes and the solid state battery

QuantumScape is not the only company considering solid state batteries. Startups working on this technology include Ionic Materials, Solid Energy (General Motors is an investor), and Prieto Battery. Sakti3, acquired by vacuum builder Dyson, was developing solid state batteries, as was the Bosch-acquired Seeo with its polymer electrolyte. Toyota has made significant investments in solid-state battery development.

Snydacker added: ""Lithium metal anodes go back to the very first lithium battery, invented by Exxon in the 1970s. In the four decades since Exxon's battery, many generations of battery scientists have tried and failed to create a commercial viable lithium metal battery that is rechargeable.""

""The major challenge with lithium metal is its propensity to undergo strong, often violent chemical reactions with almost every known material. Approximately 99.9 percent of materials undergo a chemical reaction when they are contacted with lithium metal. And, most of these reactions propagate continuously without passivation. In rare cases, the reaction may passivate and a form a 'kinetically stable' surface on the lithium metal. A mere 0.1 percent of materials are thermodynamically stable in contact with lithium metal. These materials can be used to protect the surface of lithium metal and facilitate durable operation of a battery.""

Automotive giants vying for an advantage in electric vehicles

Volkswagen has worked with QuantumScape since 2012 and claims to have tested sample battery cells that perform at ""automotive rates of power."" Even with more than eight years of development and significant funding, it's still going to take a joint venture between VW and QuantumScape another seven years to get to full production. That 2025 target for QuantumScape-electrified powertrains reveals the deep technical and execution challenge of bringing a new battery technology to full industrial production.

According to VW: ""A solid-state battery would increase the range of the E-Golf to approximately 750 kilometers compared with the present 300 kilometers. This battery technology has further advantages over the present lithium-ion technology: higher energy density, enhanced safety, better fast charging capability and — above all — they take up significantly less space.""

Greater energy density is the most important driver of solid-state lithium metal batteries, said Snydacker. ""Energy density will remain a key metric for batteries for two reasons. First, for an electric vehicle with a fixed battery pack size, cells with higher energy density enable a longer driving range. Second, for an electric vehicle with a fixed range requirement, cells with higher energy density enable a smaller cheaper battery pack. New exotic chemistries with high energy density may be more costly at first, but in the long run, as manufacturing processes mature, the cost of a battery approaches the cost of its raw material. Every kilogram of savings in the battery translates to a kilogram of savings in raw materials.""

Corporate investors making up for lack of VC interest

As Ben Kellison, GTM's Director of grid research, recently noted, ""Strategic investors have really taken over grid VC investment over the last 18 months or so, leading to lower total investment totals, but more meaningful investments."" The bulk of ""grid"" investment still goes to energy storage technologies.

So why does battery technology seem like a minefield to most traditional venture capital investors?

Shahin Farshchi, a partner at VC investor Lux Capital, spoke of the VC mismatch of investing in new battery technologies. Faced with the harsh reality of thermodynamics, battery startups have to make enormous efforts in time and capital to make just ""incremental gains,"" often seeing just ""single digit percentage performance improvements at the expense of another parameter.""

VCs are conditioned to seek product improvements that wreck markets, not incremental gains. But Farshchi would not dismiss QuantumScape's chances, acknowledging, ""VC is a game of special cases.""",https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/vw-quantumscape-investment
QuantumScape & Volkswagen Sign Agreement for Joint Venture,2021-05-15 02:56:51+00:00,"SAN JOSE, Calif.–(BUSINESS WIRE)– QuantumScape Corporation, (NYSE: QS, or “QuantumScape”) today announced that it has entered into an agreement with Volkswagen Group of America, Inc. to select the location of their joint-venture solid-state battery pilot-line facility by the end of 2021. The companies currently contemplate Salzgitter, Germany for the location.

The pilot-line facility, QS-1, will initially be a 1-gigawatt hour (GWh) battery cell commercial production plant for electric vehicle batteries. QuantumScape and Volkswagen intend to expand production capacity by a further 20 GWh at the same location.

“Our goal has been to bring our solid-state lithium-metal batteries to market as soon as possible,” said Jagdeep Singh, CEO and co-founder of QuantumScape. “This joint venture brings together QuantumScape’s core battery technology with Volkswagen’s deep understanding of high-volume, high-quality production, and maximizes our ability to bring this technology into industrial production.”

QS-1 will follow QS-0, QuantumScape’s planned pre-pilot line. In its Q1 Shareholder Letter, QuantumScape highlighted progress on that front as well, securing a facility in San Jose to house the QS-0 line. To fulfill the strong inbound interest in its technology, the company also recently announced it was doubling the initial QS-0 capacity to over 200,000 cells annually, enough for hundreds of test vehicles each year.

In March, QuantumScape announced an additional $100 million in funding from Volkswagen after Volkswagen confirmed through tests at its labs in Germany that QuantumScape cells met the established technical milestone.

Volkswagen begins construction of battery cell factory,2022-07-07 00:00:00,"Volkswagen has laid the foundation stone for its first own battery factory at its components plant in Salzgitter. From 2025, the factory will produce the Volkswagen unit cell for volume models for the new ‘PowerCo’ business unit.

Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Lower Saxony’s Minister-President Stephan Weil also came to Salzgitter for the symbolic laying of the foundation stone – alongside. VW celebrities in the person of Chairman of the Board Herbert Diess, Supervisory Board Chairman Hans-Dieter Pötsch, Chief Technology Officer Thomas Schmall and the CEO of the new company PowerCo, Frank Blome. The headquarters of PowerCo – the SE in which external investors will also be able to participate – will be located directly next to the battery factory in Salzgitter.

“In hardly any other industry is the change as fundamental as in the automotive industry,” says Scholz in his speech. “This is particularly visible in Salzgitter; today half of all VW engines come from here. The change will turn out well if we don’t dwell on the old, but grab the new by the horns.”

“Here in Salzgitter it is obvious how much our industry is changing – and how much Volkswagen can be a driver of this change,” added Diess during his appearance in Hall 3. “Salzgiga will be our power centre. From here we start and control our global battery production- with the PowerCo. The battery will be the big value driver in the car, next to the software – that’s why we’re not letting it out of our hands.”

600 metres long, 350 metres wide

The factory, which is to manufacture the VW unit cell on a large scale from 2025 onwards on an area the size of 30 football pitches, is only one part of the future Salzgitter battery site. The plant, which was opened in 1970, will be home to the VW Group’s “Global Battery Hub”. This means that the group will develop, test, manufacture and also recycle batteries at the component plant. In addition, a battery academy and a supplier park will be located in Salzgitter. Salzgitter will develop the unit cell centrally for the group and then bring it to the world – in the first step to the five other battery factories to be built in Europe. In total, PowerCo (with partners) will invest 20 billion euros by 2030.

“It’s not just a foundation stone, but a milestone,” says Schmall, Chief Technology Officer. Because the cell factory in Lower Saxony will serve as a blueprint for the other locations – the factory in Sagunt near Valencia is scheduled to go into operation as early as 2026, one year after Salzgitter – followed by another 40 GWh factory every year until the end of the decade. After the expansion in Europe, PowerCo is planning further battery factories on other continents. Diess specifically mentions the USA, which had already been rumoured. However, the VW CEO did not name a location.

The standardised factory – i.e. buildings, production facilities and infrastructure such as IT and logistics – is supposed to make rapid scaling possible in the first place. It is supposed to take 18 months from the approval of a factory by the board to the start of production – instead of 36, as PowerCo CEO Frank Blome states.

Salzgitter as a blueprint for the world

The fact that PowerCo is able to build battery factories according to the ever-present Salzgitter model is due to the much-cited unit cell. This is a prismatic battery cell that is to be used in 80 per cent of the VW Group’s e-vehicles in future. Regardless of whether it is a small car, a premium saloon or an e-transporter for tradesmen: the external dimensions of the battery cells are the same in all vehicles.

“We then adjust the different vehicles via the cell chemistry,” explains Blome. “We can take out complexity compared to other cell manufacturers. That applies to cell chemistry, cell formats and also cell factories.”

In other words, both NMC and LFP cells can be used in the prismatic cell housing. The production of the different cell chemistries is even necessary on one belt. VW expects great advantages from this mixture of flexibility and standardisation. For example, the production lines are the same in all factories, so the electrode materials are always cut into the same pieces and assembled into the same stacks before they go into the housing – whether in Salzgitter, Sweden or Spain. This allows VW to order the plants in one go. In Salzgitter, the first plants are to be installed as early as the second quarter of 2023.

The flexibility between NMC and LFP cathodes, but also different material mixtures within the NMC technology, should make it possible to build the right cells for the different vehicle classes and their requirements. Sometimes with a high nickel content, sometimes with more manganese – or the cheaper LFP chemistry. With a few adjustments, it should also be possible to build solid cells in the VW factories in the future. However, battery expert Blome does not want to specify when exactly this will be the case – the next big step together with partner QuantumScape is scheduled for the end of the year.

With the ability to produce a wide variety of cell chemistries on one line, VW wants to be able to react not only to development but also to customer demand and, to some extent, to supply chains. If raw materials such as nickel become disproportionately expensive or are simply not available in sufficient quantities, the company can switch to other technologies.

Since PowerCo not only develops and builds the cells, but is also responsible for “vertical integration” – i.e. the procurement of raw materials – VW hopes to achieve the necessary speed to secure the cell supply for the constantly growing eMobility demand. In the future, the process chain of the primary products will be located at the respective factory sites in order to reduce the dependence on Asia for the important primary products.

This also means that the procurement of cell raw materials is the responsibility of Jörg Teichmann, the head of purchasing at PowerCo, and not of Murat Aksel at VW Group Procurement. However, this is where the responsibility for purchasing complete cells from other suppliers such as LG Energy Solution lies – also under anti-trust law, as Schmall emphasises.

Although the chancellor came to the laying of the foundation stone, VW did not claim any state subsidies for the battery factory in Salzgitter. According to Schmall, this decision was made primarily for reasons of speed – the requirements of the IPCEI subsidy, for example, would have slowed down the project. The other factories, however, will receive state support, partly for the construction directly, partly for the search for land or the further training of employees.

The battery factories are to be powered exclusively by green electricity. Volkswagen has installed a large PV system in Salzgitter, and projects are also being planned with energy suppliers in the surrounding area to secure the local supply of green electricity. This is to be implemented at the other locations as well, similar to the approach taken with the preliminary products.

According to Schmall, the company will announce in the coming months exactly where the three cell factories, which have not yet been confirmed, will be built (in addition to Salzgitter, Sagunt and Skelleftea with Northvolt). One factory will be built in Eastern Europe, VW has not yet given any details on plants 5 and 6. According to Schmall, there are several locations on the list and also some favourites.

Incidentally, PowerCo intends to go ahead with the announced supply of battery cells to customers outside the VW Group. “In the first step, we will enter the market for large-scale storage systems relatively quickly,” says Schmall. “In the second step, carmakers who are already platform partners will follow. And only in the third step will we then supply cells to carmakers who are not yet partners today.” Even if Schmall doesn’t call it by its name: Ford, for example, is a platform partner with the production of MEB models in Cologne.

“We don’t do that kind of nonsense!”

Before Scholz and Diess laid the symbolic foundation stone for the “Salzgiga”, Lower Saxony’s Minister President Stephan Weil had addressed 4,000 employees on the early and late shifts at a works meeting. Weil said that in 2019, during a visit to Salzgitter, he had mainly seen questioning faces as to what would become of the jobs in combustion engine and transmission production in times of climate change. “Today provides a convincing answer for Salzgitter and perhaps beyond,” Weil said. “A company like Volkswagen must take responsibility. When a new era begins, you cannot simply leave the old behind. Structural change is not a misfortune, but a task.”

Daniela Cavallo, Chairwoman of the General Works Council, also agrees: “The transformation to electromobility can very well bring good things, good jobs and secure employment.” Salzgitter, she says, should not only become a blueprint for the technical implementation of battery factories, but also for securing employment. “Our competitors are envious when they see what is being created here,” says Cavallo.

The works council leader also recalls the change that the group’s management has undergone. As recently as 2016, the response of “the then CEO” (editor’s note: Matthias Müller) to the demand for an own cell production was clear: “We don’t do that kind of nonsense!” “I’m glad he wasn’t right,” says Cavallo.
