Blackstone begins series production of lithium-ion batteries using 3D printing technology,2021-12-08 11:55:13+00:00,"Blackstone Resources, a Swiss investment firm focused on battery technology, has announced the series production of its 3D printed battery cells at its new manufacturing plant in Döbeln, Germany.

With the ultimate aim of tackling the electric vehicle market, the firm set up its own German research and development subsidiary, Blackstone Technology, in 2019.

The company has spent the past two years developing and refining its lithium-ion battery 3D printing technology, having now hosted an online event launching its first large-scale production facility.

3D printing batteries with Blackstone

According to Blackstone, the liquid electrolyte battery production lines of today tend to be very specialized, meaning they can only manufacture one type of battery at a time. The energy-intensive process is often a very expensive one, and uses dangerous solvents as raw materials for electrodes.

On the other hand, Blackstone’s ‘Thick Layer Technology’ is intended as a much more flexible and cost-effective alternative, covering a wider range of cell formats while using environmentally friendly materials. Owing to the dynamic nature of the 3D printing process, Blackstone states that it can even tailor the size and shape of the cells to the customer’s requirements.

The process reportedly allows the firm to achieve energy density improvements of around 20% when compared to traditionally manufactured counterparts, offering densities of up to 220 Wh/kg. Additional claims include space savings of up to 15%, material cost savings of 20€/kWh, and a 23% lower energy consumption in production.

Ulrich Ernst, founder and CEO of Blackstone Resources, adds, “The patented process relies on an environmentally friendly, purely water-based process and reduces waste materials by 50%. In this way, we are making an important and sustainable contribution to the transport turnaround and in the fight against climate change.”

While Blackstone is starting with lithium-ion cells, the company believes its technology will be applicable to other cell chemistries too. This includes solid-state ones, which should increase energy density by another 70%.

Shooting for 10GWh production capacity

Blackstone Technology has set its initial target annual production capacity at 500 MWh, which it expects to reach by the end of next year. Although a timeline has not been set, phase two of the growth plan will target 5GWh per year, and phase three will eventually aim for over 10GWh.

According to Holger Gritzka, managing director of Blackstone Technology, the firm’s long-term goal is to produce battery cells every second: “The vision – with a single machine park, we print cells in different shapes, different electrodes, and electrolyte materials quickly and cost-effectively on a large scale.”

To enable this goal, the company will expand its Döbeln employee count from 14 to 38 in the next year, drawing in workers from neighboring cities such as Leipzig, Chemnitz, and Dresden.

Blackstone is already working on developing a bipolar battery design with its partner Liovolt, a Germany-based energy firm. The lithium-ion cell will comprise several stacked electrodes connected in series, whereby the cathode and anode materials will be placed on a common electrode carrier.

Serhat Yilmaz, CMO at Blackstone Resources, says, “The next step is now to develop a battery system with our partner ecovolta, and with Voith SE and Orten Electric Trucks we are aiming for a project to equip electrified e-buses with our battery technology.”

The 3D printing of energy storage devices is very much a niche field, with much of the work still in the research phase. Back in October, researchers at the Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology (EMPA) used 3D printing to create a sustainable new class of supercapacitor. The fully-3D printed battery, composed of a flexible cellulose and glycerol substrate, patterned with a conductive carbon and graphite-laden ink, is able to withstand thousands of charging cycles while maintaining its capacity.

Elsewhere, Sakuu Corporation (formerly KeraCel), a specialist in 3D printed energy storage devices, recently commenced the construction of a new pilot facility for the production of its own 3D printed solid-state batteries. Expected to complete by the start of next year, the pilot line will reportedly be able to produce up to 2.5 MWh of solid-state batteries every year.

Blackstone secures 40 million Euro funding for battery manufacturing expansion,2021-08-05 00:00:00,"BAAR, Switzerland – (August 5, 2021) – Blackstone Resources AG (SWX: BLS) is pleased to announce that it has secured further investments of EUR 40 million for its German subsidiary Blackstone Technology GmbH from Blackstone Resources AG as an investor.

Blackstone announced earlier that its German subsidiary Blackstone Technology GmbH will expand its production facilities to 500 MWh per annum at its existing site in Döbeln, Saxony, in 2022. With the contract concluded today, the financing for this project has been secured.

At present, six customers from various industrial fields, have reserved capacity for our 3D-printed batteries of 1’642 MWh with a combined order value of approximately EUR 200 million.

In addition, the construction of a new development-centre in the immediate vicinity of the existing production-plant has also been financially secured. From 2022, engineers and scientists from Blackstone Technology GmbH and its partners will further develop the manufacturing processes for Blackstone’s worldwide expansion plan for its next-generation 3D-printed solid-state batteries.

This in turn, forms the basis for the future scaling up of production towards the company’s first 1000 MWh-milestone for battery production and then further on to 5,000 MWh per year . Right now, Blackstone’s most important priority is to scale up production.



The foundation has already been laid for our future with Blackstone’s 3D-printing technology. This includes further developments and products for solid-state batteries, which will allow us to gradually industrialise, disruptive product developments and establish these new products in the market. With continuous development steps running parallel to series production, we therefore guarantee the technological maturity and marketability of our next gen products today rather than tomorrow. This allows us to be present in the market right from the start and develop application-oriented solutions that are able to generate income at an early stage of development and demonstrate the quality of our solutions.

Blackstone invests in battery technology production,2021-12-21 00:00:00,"The Swiss commodities company Blackstone Resources has raised 50 million Swiss francs, the equivalent of 48 million euros, through a partial sale of a subsidiary in its precious metals division. Blackstone plans to use the money to further develop and expand its battery metals and lithium projects.

“For this sale of a minority stake, we were able to achieve a good sales price and can invest these funds in our further projects,” says Ulrich Ernst, CEO of Blackstone Resources. “We will further consolidate the market presence and production of Blackstone Technology. We will also continue to develop and expand our battery metal and lithium projects.”

Blackstone Technology is the German subsidiary that operates a battery factory in Döbeln, Saxony, where, just last week, Blackstone began the series production of its LFP cells. Using the cathode material from IBU-Tec in Weimar, the LFP cells are now being produced in Döbeln using a new 3D printing process. According to the company, this allows the power storage layers of the battery cells to become thicker, which should increase the energy density by 20 per cent – Blackstone calls this ‘Thick Layer Technology’ that allows an impressive energy density of 220 Wh/kg. By comparison, the blade batteries from the Chinese manufacturer BYD, which are considered technologically advanced LFP cells, are said to come to 166 Wh/kg at the cell level.

In the announcement on the partial sale of the Precious Metals stake, Blackstone reiterates its known goal of reaching a target production capacity of 500 MWh in Döbeln in the coming year.

Blackstone begins series production of 3D-printed battery cells,2021-12-07 00:00:00,"Blackstone Resources presented its manufacturing process for lithium-ion batteries from the 3D printer at an event at its plant in Döbeln, Saxony. The facility for series production was also started up as part of the event.

The event and production take place at Blackstone Technology, the German subsidiary of the Swiss holding company Blackstone Resources AG. Due to the Corona situation, however, the press conference had to be broadcast online.

Blackstone presented its LFP cells, announced in February, in detail. Using the cathode material from IBU-Tec in Weimar, the LFP cells are now being produced in Döbeln in the district of Central Saxony using a new 3D printing process. According to the company, this allows the power storage layers of the battery cells to become thicker, which should increase the energy density by 20 per cent – Blackstone calls this “Thick Layer Technology”. Specifically, Blackstone announced 220 Wh/kg. By comparison, the blade batteries of the Chinese manufacturer BYD, which are considered technologically advanced LFP cells, are said to come to 166 Wh/kg at the cell level.

Blackstone further states that the size of the cells can be flexibly tailored to customer requirements with the process – a carmaker with a battery pack installed in the underbody has different requirements here than the manufacturer of an electric bus who mounts the batteries on the vehicle roof. Blackstone puts the space savings at 15 per cent, the material savings at 20 euros/kWh. And the energy consumption in production is 23 per cent lower. Although Blackstone is starting with LFP and NMC cells, the technology should be applicable to all cell chemistries. Blackstone also wants to be able to print solid-state batteries – with solid-state technology, the energy density should then increase by another 70 per cent.

Battery cells by the second

Ulrich Ernst, founder and CEO of Blackstone Resources, calls the 3D-printed batteries a “game changer”. “It allows us to achieve a 20 per cent increase in the energy density of our charge carriers while drastically reducing environmentally relevant impacts,” says Ernst. “The patented process relies on an environmentally friendly, purely water-based process and reduces waste materials by 50 per cent. In this way, we are making an important and sustainable contribution to the transport turnaround and in the fight against climate change.”

During the event, not only was the cell presented, but series production of the electrode was also started. The target production capacity of 500 MWh is to be reached at the site as early as next year. The long-term goal is to produce battery cells every second, says Holger Gritzka, managing director of Blackstone Technology. The vision: “With a single machine park, we print cells in different shapes, different electrodes and electrolyte materials quickly and cost-effectively on a large scale.”

Currently, 14 people are employed in Döbeln, with plans to expand to 38 employees in the coming year. The German subsidiary Blackstone Technology built the production facility in an existing building to save time. According to Gritzka, the property had not only convinced him with its suitable size and its as-new condition, but also with its location: cities such as Leipzig, Chemnitz and Dresden are all quite similarly distant, which should simplify the search for qualified employees.

Incidentally, the fact that the production start announced in February could not be kept in the summer was not due to the employees – but unsurprisingly to the Corona pandemic: the production plant could only be completed after a three-month delay due to delivery problems and restrictions.

Not only Blackstone representatives appeared at the virtual event, but also partners such as Robert Orten from Orten Electric Trucks, Thomas Sautter from Voith, Benjamin Friedirch from Ecovolta and Michael Roscher from Liovolt. “The next step is now to develop a battery system with our partner ecovolta, and with Voith SE and Orten Electric Trucks we are aiming for a project to equip electrified e-buses with our battery technology,” says Serhat Yilmaz, CMO at Blackstone Resources.

Expansion plans inside Germany and around the world

In addition, Blackstone is already working with its partner Liovolt on a further development; a bipolar battery. These are lithium-ion batteries consisting of stacked electrodes connected in series, which are designed to be bipolar. “This means that the active materials for the cathode and, on the other side, the active materials for the anode are placed on a common electrode carrier,” Yilmaz explains.

In perspective, production is to be expanded beyond the 500 MWh of Phase I: In his presentation, Gritzka also spoke of small-scale production. The second phase will have a capacity of five GWh per year and will also be built in Germany. Then, in addition to pouch cells, prismatic cells are also to be produced. Phase III, an automotive cell with “10+ GWh/year”, is to be implemented through an expansion in Germany and a worldwide expansion. However, Gritzka did not give a timetable for phases II and III.

Blackstone aims for 500 MWh production capacity in 2022,2021-07-05 00:00:00,"Blackstone Technology, the German subsidiary of the Swiss commodities company Blackstone Resources, wants to increase its annual production capacity at the Döbeln site tenfold – from currently 50 MWh to around 500 MWh in the coming year.

++ This article has been updated. Kindly continue reading below. ++

In Döbeln, Blackstone manufactures lithium-ion batteries with 3D-printed electrodes for small series. In February, the company specified that these will be batteries with LFP chemistry. In the short term, the company is mainly planning to produce pouch cells with its in-house thick layer technology; in parallel, Blackstone is working on the development of solid-state batteries and their production processes.

In addition to the expansion of production capacities in Döbeln to 500 MWh in the coming year, Blackstone also announced that it has recently signed a letter of intent with Triathlon Batterien, a German manufacturer of battery systems for industrial trucks. The agreement covers the delivery of “a significant quantity of battery cells with a potential of several 100 MWh over the total term”, Blackstone writes. In addition, there are further declarations of intent with customers from the marine applications, electric motorcycles and electric commercial vehicles and electric buses sectors with a value of approximately 184 million euros.

The German subsidiary of the Swiss raw materials group announced the Saxon city of Döbeln as its production site in October 2020. Among other things, to finance the modern production facilities on site, the manufacturer concluded a contract for a convertible loan of up to 20 million Swiss francs (around 18.5 million euros) at the beginning of the year. The company aims to differentiate itself from the competition with a patented 3D technology for printing cells based on LFP technology.

In February, Blackstone presented a pre-production sample cell that is ready for series production in Döbeln and is to be launched on the market. In terms of the energy density of this cell, the company is aiming for more than 220 Wh per kilogram. “Although LFP technology typically has a lower energy density in comparison to other battery chemistries, the Blackstone’s proprietary thick-layer technology that is used at Blackstone Technology, cancels out these disadvantages,” the company elaborated in February. “In fact, the LFP battery technology presented offers 20-25% more energy density compared to current lithium-ion battery technology.” In the current announcement, Blackstone reiterates this claim (“20% higher density”).

LFP cells alone will not be enough, according to earlier statements. Other combinations with other metals such as NMC batteries are additionally planned for production, it said in February. In addition, the printing technology allows the batteries to be manufactured in different shapes, for example specifically for electric cars, electric buses and electric motorbikes. “However, by Blackstone’s own 3D-printing technology, batteries can be manufactured in almost any shape and size, which not only gives more room for design freedom, but also helps to make optimum use of the available installation space, plus it is very economical,” Blackstone wrote.

Parent company Blackstone Resources AG had first put itself on the radar in January 2019 as a player in setting up battery cell manufacturing in this country. At the time, the Swiss firm spoke of wanting to produce 100 million battery cells per year in a first phase, enough for 25,000 to 100,000 electric car batteries. In a further phase, production was to be “greatly increased”, they said. Earlier this year, it also became public that the company is participating in a research alliance for the electrification of EU shipping. Blackstone Resources’ core business is battery metals and refinery development. In view of the increasing demand in the course of electric vehicle and battery production, the group announces in the current announcement that it will “establish, develop and operate production facilities for battery metals such as lithium, cobalt, manganese, graphite, nickel and copper in order to participate in this trend (of electromobility, editor’s note)”.

Update 22 July 2021

Blackstone Technology has received the official operating permit from the authorities in Döbeln to start small-scale production of 3D-printed lithium-ion battery cells. In addition, the Sächsische Aufbaubank SAB has approved funding for the investments. The subsidies are part of the so-called GRW programme (“Gemeinschaftsaufgabe Verbesserung der regionalen Wirtschaftsstruktur”, or Joint Task Improvement of the Regional Economic Structure in English). Specifically, the Sächsische Aufbaubank (Saxon Development Bank) has given Blackstone a decision on a 20 per cent subsidy for the investment expenditure. An absolute amount of funding is not specified.

Production in Döbeln will start in September 2021 after the installation of the machinery and equipment has been completed, according to an accompanying statement.

Update 06.08.2021

Blackstone Technology has secured financing for the announced expansion of its production facilities in Döbeln to 500 MWh per year in 2022. This is made possible by a further investment of €40 million by the parent company Blackstone Resources.

Further, the company reports a combined order value of approximately EUR 200 million, with which the expansion is justified. Blackstone’s next reported goal is the 1000 MWh-milestone for battery production and then further on to 5,000 MWh per year.
