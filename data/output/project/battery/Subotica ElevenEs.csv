SUBOTICA, Serbia, Oct. 21, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- By 2030, Europe will need 14 times more batteries than it produces today. This is due to the growth of electric mobility and the energy storage market, which requires batteries to stabilise energy systems, especially given the growing share of renewable energy. Therefore, Lithium Iron Phosphate (LFP) batteries, which combine the advantages of long life, affordability and safety, are gaining an increasingly stronger position in the rapidly growing battery market.

ElevenEs, an industrial spin-off of the multinational Al Pack Group, which specialises in aluminium processing and has been operating on the packaging market for 25 years, has developed its own technology to produce lithium-iron-phosphate batteries that are more sustainable and efficient . The company, which has been conducting R&D into LFP lithium-ion batteries since October 2019 has just recently opened an advanced research and development centre in Subotica, Serbia, where it employs an international team of engineers and scientists.

""LFP cells last more than twice as long as competing chemistries, they can be recharged up to 6,000 times, charge faster, can be repeatedly charged to 100% state-of-charge and cause practically no fires in EVs. On top of that, they cost significantly less. It is the most popular choice in China today, which is still the global leader in battery technology,"" says Nemanja Mikać, founder and CEO of ElevenEs.

Strategic partnership for the gigafactory

ElevenEs has just signed agreements with EIT InnoEnergy, which Pitchbook ranks as the most active sustainable energy investor globally, known for being the first investor in other successful battery gigafactory ventures, such as Swedish Northvolt (recently closed $2,75 bn financing round) and French Verkor (closed a $100 m founding round and secured a strategic partnership with Renault in July 2021). The entities announced a strategic partnership to build the first LFP lithium-ion battery gigafactory in Europe.

By 2023, The ElevenEs plant will be able to produce LFP cells with a total estimated annual capacity of 300 MWh. The construction of the 100% renewable energy powered 8 GWh plant in Subotica (Serbia) will start in 2024. It will later be expanded to a capacity of 16 GWh – enough to equip more than 300,000 electric vehicles (BEVs) with batteries each year. The company has stated that it intends to employ up to 2,000 employees. Another key advantage is the fact that the facility is also very close to Jadar Valley, the largest deposit of lithium in Europe.

""LFP batteries are the next big thing on the battery landscape. Although nickel-based batteries outperform LFP on energy density and are likely to remain the best option for performance cars, LFP is far better in terms of cost, safety and lifetime, making it a perfect choice for industrial, ESS and city EV (shorter range) applications,"" says Jakub Miler, CEO at EIT InnoEnergy Central Europe.

""We have been working with ElevenEs for the past year and a half, and what came as the biggest surprise to us is that as much as 70% of the aluminium packaging process and know-how coming from their mother company, Al Pack Group, can be easily transferred to cell production. Having now developed their own LPF technology, that industrial experience of the Al Pack Group should allow them to progress much faster than any of their peers. And we are very excited to be taking that journey together.""

ElevenEs Empower Everything,,"ElevenEs produces a prototype of the largest LFP battery cell in Europe Back to News

ElevenEs has completed a 2-year development program and produced a prototype of the largest battery cell in Europe. Customer deliveries to start in the first quarter of 2023.

Subotica, 26.09.2022

The first and largest full-size LFP (Lithium Iron Phosphate) battery cell in Europe was developed by ElevenEs, a pioneer in battery cell development. Its first batches will be shipped for customer testing in the first quarter of 2023. The company announced that its EDGE battery cell would be displayed at The Business Booster, EIT InnoEnergy’s annual international networking event that showcases over 150 leading sustainable energy technologies from around the world, held in Lisbon, Portugal, on September 28th and 29th this year.

LFP technology, which according to Bloomberg NEF in 2022, will reach 40% of the global battery market share, is characterized by greater safety, lower cost, and increased sustainability (does not require nickel and cobalt). In addition to its proven safety features in electric vehicles, LFP batteries last twice as long as the most common competing technologies. In recent months, leading car companies such as Tesla, Volkswagen, BMW, Mercedes, Ford, and others have already introduced LFP cells in their fleets.

“After creating and testing more than 500 laboratory sample cells, we have developed the final cell chemistry and design and grown into an international team into nearly 50 people. We are delivering according to our plans and expect to close our Series B financing round later this year, expand our production capabilities to 300-500MWh, and onboard several strategic investors to accelerate our growth further,” said Nemanja Mikać, CEO of ElevenEs. Additionally, he has highlighted that ElevenEs will offer to the market 3 distinct EDGE battery cell sizes in a prismatic format, which will be competitive against all presently available mass-produced batteries in the global market.

“A year ago, at the same conference, this company was still only an early development project, and this battery did not exist. It is impressive to see what they have accomplished in such a short time,” said Diego Pavia, CEO of EIT InnoEnergy.

ElevenEs is an industrial spin-off project of Al Pack Group, a multinational aluminum processing leader with almost three decades of experience and know-how in high-precision aluminum processing, a key component of the electrode production that forms the active part of the LFP battery.

The laboratory and the R&D center have been operational since June 2021, and the first-stage production plant will be completed by January 2023. The first stage of giga-scale production (8GWh), with its capacity to deliver batteries for 200.000 cars per year, is expected by the end of 2025. A further expansion plan is expected to be announced soon.

Despite an increased number of startup companies announcing expansion plans, the battery market in Europe remains underserved.

For companies that are far advanced in product development, such as ElevenEs, the rapid growth will come from a relentless product focus and well-executed industrialization strategy. Europe’s demand for sustainable and localized batteries is on the rise, so the reliability and product leadership of European battery makers is becoming imperative.",https://elevenes.com/en/news/elevenes-produces-a-prototype-of-the-largest-lfp-battery-cell-in-europe

ElevenEs Empower Everything,,"ElevenEs opens Europe's first LFP battery cell manufacturing facility Back to News

ElevenEs’s first industrial facility dedicated to LFP battery cell production is fully operational.

Subotica, Serbia

The production site, located in Subotica, Serbia, specializes in producing high-quality LFP prismatic cells which are shipped to customers for sample A and B testing across a variety of applications, including electric cars, buses, trucks and energy storage systems.

The LFP cell market is expected to see significant growth in the coming years, with over nine-fold growth in global sales over the past two years alone, and is forecasted to be the number one battery cell chemistry utilized by the end of this decade. This comes as no surprise, as LFP battery cell chemistry offers greater safety, lower cost, and increased sustainability since the technology does not utilize nickel or cobalt. LFP battery cells also last three times as long as the most common competing technologies, making them the most cost-efficient battery solution on the market. Along with the overall benefits of LFP chemistry, ElevenEs’s EDGE battery cells offer higher energy density on a pack-level compared to other LFP cell designs.

In addition to their focus on providing high-quality LFP cells, ElevenEs has implemented a range of initiatives to promote sustainable production, including the use of renewable energy sources for facility operation, a combination of hydro, wind and solar power. The company also plans to source all the necessary active materials from Europe which will limit the carbon footprint of the LFP battery cells produced.

The opening of the manufacturing facility represents a significant step forward for ElevenEs. The industrial facility will expand to become the company’s Mega-Factory in 2024, producing 500MWh, focusing, but not limited to, C and D samples. ElevenEs’s roadmap includes operating two Gigafactories: Giga-I producing 8GWh by 2026 and Giga-II producing 40GWh by the end of 2027. At which point, the company will operate at a combined capacity of 48GWh - which equates to enough battery cells to power one million medium-sized electric cars each year.

“The expansion of our R&D center and opening of our first production facility in Serbia is a huge milestone for ElevenEs and the European battery cell market as a whole. We’re proud of our contribution to reducing the global footprint starting with our battery cells’ local production”, said Nemanja Mikac, ElevenEs CEO.



ElevenEs is committed to efficiently providing its customers with high-quality LFP cells, and the new facility enables them to meet growing battery cell demand. With a focus on sustainability, ElevenEs is poised to continue its growth and enable their mission to make a clean future accessible for all.

ABOUT US

At ElevenEs, we believe that a clean future belongs to everyone, which is why we are on a mission to produce high-quality cost-effective battery cells. Our battery cell, EDGE, is the first cobalt and nickel-free battery produced in Europe, which also utilizes a hundred percent renewable energy in the production process.

ElevenEs’s cutting-edge battery cells enable efficient cell-to-pack solutions, minimizing cost-per-cycle and increasing energy density on a battery pack level - powering electric cars, buses, trucks and energy storage systems.",https://elevenes.com/en/news/elevenes-opens-europe-s-first-lfp-battery-cell-manufacturing-facility
ElevenEs kicks off LFP battery cell production in Serbia,2023-04-25 00:00:00,"The Serbian company ElevenEs has opened a plant for the production of battery cells. It is located in Subotica, Serbia, and specialises in the production of prismatic LFP cells. By 2024, the plant is to be expanded into a “mega-factory” with a production capacity of 500 MWh.

According to ElevenEs, the cells produced in Subotica will now initially be supplied as samples to customers for use in electric cars, buses, trucks and stationary energy storage systems. The 500 MWh expansion stage will also “focus on, but not be limited to, C and D samples”, according to a company statement. In doing so, it said it intends to “source all necessary active materials from Europe in order to reduce the carbon footprint of the LFP battery cells produced”.

A research and development centre was opened in Subotica, Serbia, in mid-2021. The now-opened production is closely interwoven with this. In principle, ElevenEs aims to build two large production facilities with a total capacity of 48 GWh in the coming years. The first, with an annual capacity of 8 GWh, is scheduled to come on stream in 2026, and the second, with 40 GWh of capacity per year, in late 2027.

“The expansion of our R&D center and opening of our first production facility in Serbia is a huge milestone for ElevenEs and the European battery cell market as a whole. We’re proud of our contribution to reducing the global footprint starting with our battery cells’ local production,” expressed Nemanja Mikac, CEO of ElevenEs.

Incidentally, ElevenEs first made its presence felt in the autumn of 2021, when the Serbian company announced a strategic partnership with EIT InnoEnergy to build the first LFP battery gigafactory in Europe. This is the 8 GWh plant mentioned above and at the time it was said that construction would also start in Subotica in 2024 and that a capacity expansion to 16 GWh later was planned. The current announcement does not specifically mention the start of construction, the location or the 16 GWh.

Last year ElevenEs presented a prototype of its LFP cell. The developer speaks of “the largest battery cell manufactured in Europe”, which is to be launched in three sizes – each in prismatic format. After developing and testing more than 500 laboratory sample cells, they developed the final cell chemistry and design and grew into an international team of almost 50 people, Mikać announced last September.

ElevenEs says it is a spin-off of the AI Pack Group, a large aluminium processor. The company started work on an LFP battery in 2019, with the aim of developing a particularly sustainable and efficient cell. Investor EIT InnoEnergy is not new to the battery technology space: EIT is also one of the early investors in Swedish company Northvolt and French startup Verkor, which has since struck a deal with Renault. How much EIT InnoEnergy invested in ElevenEs in 2021 is not known.
