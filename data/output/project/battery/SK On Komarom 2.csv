SK Innovation subsidized for Hungarian battery plant,2021-07-20 00:00:00,"The South Korean battery cell manufacturer SK Innovation received a subsidy of 90 million euros from the Hungarian government for its second plant in the country. The prerequisite was that the EU Commission give the green light for the state aid, which has now happened.

SK Innovation says it is investing about 945 billion won in the construction of its second plant in Komárom – the equivalent of just under 700 million euros. SKI is now receiving the 90 million euro subsidy from the Hungarian state “regarding the anticipated positive effects on the local economy and employment from the operation of the second EV plant in Hungary”, as the battery manufacturer announced.

By way of background, the Commission, taking into account EU state aid rules and in particular Article 107(3c) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, may authorise member states to support the development of certain economic sectors “under certain conditions”. These economic sectors must be of common European interest.

In the case of SKI, the European Commission approved the Hungarian government’s subsidy plan after a ten-month review. “This is an exceptional case for the European Commission, which is known to be very strict about giving approvals, to grant such huge amount of subsidy to a Korean company in such a short period,” SK Innovation writes.

In June, the group division had already received a loan of 500 million US dollars from the Export-Import Bank of Korea for the same plant. The loan is a green loan fund, which SKI says it obtained on “favourable financial terms”. SK Innovation’s second battery cell plant will be built in the same way as the first plant in Komárom and is to have an annual capacity of 10 GWh. The plan is for construction to be completed this year and commercial production to begin in 2022. Earlier this year, SK Innovation also decided to build a third battery cell factory in Hungary, specifically in Iváncsa, 50 kilometres southwest of Budapest.

SKI currently only develops and produces pouch cells. As SK Innovation’s battery boss Jee Dong-seob recently confirmed at South Korea’s largest battery trade fair, Inter Battery, the company is also looking into the development and production of new types of battery cells, including cylindrical and prismatic cells. In this way, the South Korean company wants to expand their customer base. As is well known, Tesla relies on round cells in various formats, but the vehicles from the Giga Shanghai also use other cell types in some cases. While the pouch cell initially seemed to prevail among European carmakers, the VW Group’s new unit cell will be a prismatic cell.

At the beginning of July, SK Innovation announced its intention to expand its production capacities to a total of over 500 GWh by 2030 and to consider an IPO of the battery division. The expansion of the division is driven, among other things, by the high order backlog: according to SKI, there are orders for more than one TWh – i.e. 1,000 GWh. At the same time, the company currently has a production capacity of only 40 GWh per year.

According to SKI, the orders are worth 130 trillion won, which is equivalent to about 97 billion euros. These batteries are expected to be able to power about 14 million electric cars. “SK Innovation aims to become a global leader in EV battery market through aggressive investment,” Jee Dong-seob said, according to the latest announcement. “We will make consistent efforts to contribute to the development of local communities and EV market.”

SK Innovation to build $859mn EV battery plant in Hungary,2020-05-19 10:01:28+00:00,"South Korean petroleum refining company SK Innovation announced today an investment of US$859mn in the construction of an electric vehicle (EV) battery plant in Komárom, Hungary. The facility, which the Budapest Business Journal reports will cover 112,000 square meters, will be the company’s second in the country.

In 2018, SK Innovation began construction of the first plant, which cost approximately $350mn. The original facility, also located in Komárom, has a capacity of 7.5GW per hour. Upon its completion in 2021, SK Innovation’s total global capacity is expected to include the No.1 Komarom plant (7.5GWh per year) and the new No.2 Komarom plant in Hungary, Changzhou plant in China (7.5GWh per year), Georgia plant in the U.S. (9.8GWh per year), in addition to the Seosan plant in Korea (4.7GWh per year).

The decision is part of SK Innovation’s initiative to strengthen its operations and presence in the European region. ""SK Innovation will be able to strengthen the position of our battery business in the European market by deciding to build a new plant as an expansion of our first plant in Europe,"" Kim Jun, CEO of SK Innovation, said. ""SK Innovation will become one of the best global EV battery producers by 2022 and raise the value of our company by obtaining production capacity to utilize our technological process.""

Last year, SK Innovations won a lucrative contract with Volkswagen AG and Daimler AG to supply the German car manufacturers with batteries for their electric vehicle offerings in the United States and Europe, according to a Bloomberg report. By 2020, according to Reuters, Volkswagen will offer a range of 25 electrified vehicles, with 12 of those being fully electric.

SK Innovation To Build Third EV Battery Plant In Hungary,2021-01-31,"SK Innovation intends to build a third lithium-ion battery cell plant in Hungary. The company already operates a 7.5 GWh factory in Komarom and is building the second 10 GWh factory at the site.

The new, third factory willt be located in Ivancsa and produce up to 30 GWh of cells annually. The construction should start in the third quarter of this year, while the start of production is scheduled for early 2024. The plant should be fully completed by 2028. At this point, we are not sure what will be the final manufacturing capacity.

According to media reports, the initial investment in the new site will be 1.3 trillion won ($1.16 billion), but the total cost, by 2028, is expected at 2.6 trillion won ($2.3 billion).

SK Innovation supplies batteries to multiple global manufacturers, including Volkswagen, Ford and Hyundai. Hungary is in a great position to become a battery hub because multiple car factories are in a relatively close proximity.

However, probably the biggest factor in selecting the country for the investment is something else - subsidies. Bloomberg reports:

""Hungary plans to provide the biggest investment subsidy in its history, Szijjarto said, adding that the government would make the size of the aid public once the agreement was signed with SK Innovation and the process of notification with the EU has been completed.""

Hungary simply is willing to offer a high incentive to attract a plant that will have 2,500 direct jobs.

Currently, SK Innovation's total battery manufacturing capacity (globally) stands at about 40 GWh annually, but it's expected to increase several times over just a few years.

SK Innovation to invest 750 million euros in Hungarian battery plant,2019-02-28 11:15:21+00:00,"Korean battery producer SK Innovation is investing additional 239 billion forint (750 million euro) in its plant in Komarom, northern Hungary.

The construction of the facility, which will manufacture batteries for electric vehicles, will begin in March, and production is expected to begin in late 2021 or early 2022. This will help SK Innovation to take a step closer to its mid- and long-term goals to increase battery production capacity to 60GWh by 2022.

“SK Innovation will be able to strengthen the position of our battery business in the European market by deciding to build a new plant as an expansion of our first plant in Europe,” said SK Innovation CEO, Kim Jun.

“The government will be contributing to the project with non-returnable funding, but negotiations with the investors are still underway with relation to the level of that funding,” added the Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade Péter Szijjártó, justifying the state assistance with the high-added-value-generating production and the deployment of state-of-the-art technologies in Hungary.

Citing the many high added value investments launched in recent years, the minister also refuted the fact that only the number of assembly plants is growing in Hungary.

“The significance of engineering, service and development centres that employ highly-trained workers has increased markedly, and in 2018 new workplaces offered an average salary of 425,000 forints, much higher than the 305,000 forint average of the previous year,” Mr Szijjártó added.",https://emerging-europe.com/business/sk-innovation-to-invest-750-million-euros-in-hungarian-battery-plant/
SK Innovation raises 500 million US dollars to build the second battery factory in Hungary,2021-06-10,"According to foreign media reports, South Korea's SK Innovation said on June 9 that it had raised a $500m green loan from the Export-Import Bank of Korea to support the construction of its second electric car battery factory in Komarom, Hungary.

SK Innovation said the loan was valid for up to seven years and was based on ""favourable terms"" thanks to SK Innovation's full guarantee. The green loan is a financial tool for ""green growth"" projects aimed at expanding economic growth while reducing the use of fossil fuels. In addition, the company plans to build a third Hungarian battery plant in Ivancsa with an annual capacity of 30GWh.

, SK Innovation made a $717 million green loan in 2019 to invest in overseas electric car battery and diaphragm plants. The company's U. S. operations issued $450 million worth of green bonds last year and $1 billion this year to invest in its Georgia battery plant. So far, SK Innovation has raised more than $3 billion in green financing.

On the same day, SK Innovation said at Inter battery, South Korea's largest battery show, that it was considering producing new types of electric vehicle batteries, including cylindrical and prismatic cells, to expand its customer base. At present, the company has only bag cells.

SK Innovation signed an agreement with Hyundai Kia in April to jointly develop new bag cells for hybrid electric vehicles, but this is the first time the company has admitted that it plans to develop batteries of completely different shapes. Participants in the exhibition include Moon Sung-wook, South Korean battery ecosystem official and Minister of Industry.",https://news.metal.com/newscontent/101502885/SK-Innovation-raises-500-million-US-dollars-to-build-the-second-battery-factory-in-Hungary/

Description

The Hungarian subsidiary of South Korean chemical enterprise SK Innovation is expected to launch production in its first Hungary-based electric battery plant in Komárom in August 2020. At the same time, another battery plant is under construction as well – in the same town – that is expected to begin operation in late 2021. Together, the two plants are projected to create some 1,410 jobs. By 2023, however, the combined workforce of the two plants together might even reach 2,500. The factories will manufacture batteries for electric cars.

The investment cost of the two factories amount to a combined HUF 416 billion (roughly €1.2 billion as at 23 April 2020).

The Hungarian site is the Korean firm’s first foreign location. SK Innovation has expanded its Hungarian investment plan due to fact that the explosion of demand for electric vehicle batteries kept defying expectations.

There is no indication of any change in the expansion plans of SK Innovation due to the COVID-19 pandemics.

Samsung SDI, Inzi Controls and GS Yuasa have also chosen Hungary as sites for electromibility-related battery production, establishing Hungary as a prominent hub of battery production.
