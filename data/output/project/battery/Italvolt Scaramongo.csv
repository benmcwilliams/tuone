Italvolt chooses the former Olivetti area of Scarmagno to build Italy’s first Gigafactory – Italvolt,2021-02-18 15:45:00+00:00,"Italvolt, founded and led by Lars Carlstrom, the businessman who has been pioneering the automotive industry with over 30 years of experience, announces they have chosen Scarmagno, where the Olivetti industrial area once stood, to build the first Gigafactory in Italy. The factory will be dedicated to the production and storage of lithium-ion batteries for electric vehicles. The first stage of the project, envisaging an overall investment of approximately 4 billion Euros, will be completed by Spring of 2024.

The former Olivetti area in Scarmagno, owned by the Monteverdi Fund managed by Prelios SGR, was selected by Italvolt because of its especially favorable technical features and strategic geographical position. Today, the site is a large decommissioned industrial lot that stands on an area of about 1 million square meters, chosen in the past for Olivetti by architects Marco Zanuso and Eduardo Vittoria because of its excellent road and rail connections with Ivrea and with the city of Turin. Another factor that makes Scarmagno ideal for Italvolt’s project is its strong bond with the productive capability of Piedmont, the leading region in Italy in automotive industrial production.

Italvolt’s Gigafactory, with its 300,000 m2 of floor space and an initial capacity of 45 GWh, is an important opportunity for the economic and industrial rebirth of the Scarmagno area and will have a significant impact on the region as well. It is estimated, in fact, that the plant will employ 4,000 workers and will create up to another 15,000 new jobs in allied activities.

The new plant, designed to be easily capable of meeting the growing demand for batteries in Europe that is expected to increase 17 times to approx. 3,600 gigawatt (GWh) by 2030, will be designed by the Architecture Division of Pininfarina, the iconic automotive design brand that has just recently celebrated its 90 years of activity and is already participating in other similarly large projects. With a strong focus on environmental and social impact, Pininfarina intends to develop a new-generation, intelligent and responsible industrial plant by applying DFMA construction methods and by opening the building out to its surroundings, making it merge into the economic and social fabric of the region. Comau, a world leader in industrial automation, with over 45 years of experience and strongly specialized in electrification processes, will be the supplier of innovative solutions, systems and technologies for the gigaplant.

Comau will also see to the construction of the Research & Development center that will be home to academic and industrial partners committed to the development of the most forward-thinking technologies in the electric mobility sector.

Lars Carlstrom, CEO and founder of Italvolt, claimed: “The support of the Piedmont Region, of the local government authorities and of the trade associations in the last eight months has been key to our decision-making process. We are especially happy with the opportunity of starting our project in Piedmont where we have found the perfect combination of factors that I believe are necessary for furthering the transition towards green industrialization: solid industrial tradition and highly specialized technological know-how in the automotive sector. Last but not least, we are honored that we will be able to build our Gigafactory in the Scarmagno area that was once occupied by the Olivetti industrial complex, a company that has written an important page of Italy’s industrial history and that today is still an icon of Made in Italy technology”.",https://www.italvolt.com/italvolt-chooses-the-former-olivetti-area-of-scarmagno-to-build-italys-first-gigafactory/
Strategic advancement of Italvolt's 45 GWh Gigafactory – Italvolt,2021-09-09 15:28:49+00:00,"Italvolt Spa, a company founded by Lars Carlstrom with the aim of building in Italy one of Europe’s largest gigafactories, has signed a binding agreement with Prelios Sgr, the agent managing the Monteverdi Fund, for the purchase of a 1 million m2 area in the municipality of Scarmagno (Turin), once the site of the Olivetti factory. Italvolt’s gigafactory for the production and storage of lithium-ion batteries for electric vehicles, which will have a production capacity of 45 GWh when fully operative, is one of the most important industrial projects in recent years in Italy, with a total investment of approximately EUR 3.4 billion.

The former Olivetti area of Scarmagno has been selected by Italvolt for its technical characteristics and its particularly strategic geographical location in terms of road and rail connections. Another factor that makes the former Olivetti area ideal for hosting Italvolt’s project is its strong link to the production fabric of Piedmont, Italy’s leading region in the automotive industry. The land will be reclaimed and redeveloped by Italvolt, with an area of 300 thousand m2 dedicated to the construction of the new plant, 20 thousand m2 of which will be used to build a Research& Development centre.

The next step for Italvolt is to obtain the building permits, expected by early 2022, so that work can begin in the second half of the year. The new plant will be designed by Pininfarina’s Architecture Division with a strong focus on its environmental and social impact. Pininfarina intends to design a new-generation industrial plant, integrated into the economic and social dynamics of the area.

Lars Carlstrom, CEO and Founder of Italvolt said: “The agreement with Prelios Sgr represents a key step in the implementation plan of our gigafactory project. We are very pleased to have concluded the purchase of the area within the time frame reconfirmed with the local and political institutions that in recent months have made a significant contribution to the promotion of Italvolt’s project. The decommissioned area has a great potential that we can give back to the local context by offering jobs and environmental requalification”.

The first half of 2021 has seen a strong acceleration of the electric mobility industry in Europe and globally. In Italy, for example, registrations of electric and plug-in hybrid cars quadrupled in the first six months of 2021 compared to the same period last year. Demand for lithium-ion batteries in Europe is expected to grow at a rate of 24% per year, led by e-mobility, exceeding 1,200 GWh in 2035. As things stand, considering the announced gigafactory openings in Europe, this would result in a production gap of more than 250 GWh.

Lars Carlstrom added: “We are proud to be the initiators of a project that will become the largest gigafactory in Southern Europe. We are confident that this will pave the way for new industrial initiatives dedicated to battery production in Italy. In order to reach the highly challenging goal proposed by the European Commission of completing the transition to a zero-emission automotive industry by 2035, battery production must be accelerated and Italvolt is ready to play its part”.

Patrick Del Bigio, CEO of Prelios Sgr, commented: “We are very pleased with the result achieved with this transaction, because the area that once hosted the historic Olivetti factory will come back to life in the coming months with a new industrial project focused on the business of electric mobility, which today is a highly strategic and innovative sector, just as Olivetti was in the 1960s in the IT sector. The industrial vocation of the site therefore remains solid, with the important socio-economic repercussions that will derive from it, fully consistent with a growing green perspective. With this awareness, Prelios SGR has also been particularly committed and has contributed to the success of the operation by working closely with representatives of the public administration and with all the other players involved, as well as defining the best value of the real estate asset”.

Andrea Tronzano, Councillor for the Budget of the Piedmont Region, said: “This is a moment of great advancement for Piedmont. This step is extraordinarily important for the Canavese area and beyond, and demonstrates Italvolt’s intent to build the battery factory on schedule. Piedmont wants a gigafactory and this news can only give us great pleasure. Now we will develop the business plan further in order to facilitate the dialogue with the Government for the resources of the Italian Recovery and Resilience Plan”.

The fulfilment of the agreement is subject to certain conditions precedent of an administrative kind and is expected within 12 months of its undersigning.

As for the legal aspects, Italvolt was assisted by Dentons, with a team led by Managing Partner Federico Sutti and comprises Partner Federico Vanetti and the Associates Lorenzo Ugolini and Cristina Garlaschelli, while Prelios Sgr was assisted by GDP – Studio Legale e Tributario with a team led by Founding Partner Prof. Andrea Gemma, with Partner Elisabetta Mattozzi and Managing Associate Chiara Adele Pero.",https://www.italvolt.com/a-binding-agreement-has-been-signed-for-the-purchase-of-the-former-olivetti-area-in-scarmagno-amounting-to-a-surface-area-of-1-million-square-metres/
Italvolt signs Memorandum of Understanding for the Gigafactory of Scarmagno and Romano Canavese – Italvolt,2022-04-21 13:33:44+00:00,"The Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) for the project was presented by Italvolt S.p.A., the company founded by Swedish entrepreneur Lars Carlstrom, and signed today at the Piedmont Region headquarters.

The purpose of the MoU is to coordinate the actions and procedures of the signatories – the Piedmont Region, the Metropolitan City of Turin and the municipalities of Scarmagno, Romano Canavese and Ivrea – to ensure efficient administrative action concerning the construction of the Gigafactory, which will be built on the former Olivetti site in Scarmagno and Romano Canavese.

The Italvolt project plans to start the production of lithium-ion batteries in the second half of 2024 and it expects to employ up to 3,000 employees, on a total area of 1,000,000m2 to deliver a production capacity of 45 GWh. The Gigafactory of Scarmagno and Romano Canavese will secure Piedmont’s position as a hub for green industrialization and sustainable mobility, making Italy one of the largest producers of lithium-ion batteries for electric vehicles and energy storage in Europe.

“After the presentation of the preliminary project and the subsequent authorization obtained at the beginning of 2022, the signing of the Memorandum of Understanding confirms the progress of a project that is proceeding rapidly thanks to constant collaboration with all the local authorities. Respecting the shared timeline will lead us to become one of the first players in Europe to start production, thus ensuring Italvolt’s key role in the EV industry,” said Lars Carlstrom, Italvolt Founder and CEO.

“The signing of this protocol,” commented Piedmont Region President Alberto Cirio and Councillor for Economic Development Andrea Tronzano, “is a clear demonstration of how the Gigafactory in Scarmagno is becoming increasingly concrete. A punctual timetable that marks the approach of a project that will bring the benefits: development and employment; two fundamental successes for the territory and the Piedmontese economy in the strategic sectors, technology and automotive. This protocol is a classic example of the collaboration of a Piedmontese system that can grow and has a future.

“Città Metropolitana di Torino will play a crucial role in the plant’s authorisation process,” says Sonia Cambursano, the councillor responsible for economic development, “in synergy with the Piedmont Region and the municipalities. For us, networking is the best way to develop the area. In this project we see the possibility of achieving the objectives of employment and development in the Canavese area, but also of encouraging sustainable energy for mobility”.

“With the founder of Italvolt,” commented Stefano Sertoli, Mayor of the Municipality of Ivrea, “right from the first meeting in Ivrea, there was an immediate understanding that gave rise to a relationship of mutual respect and constant dialogue. I can only be pleased that the other entities involved, once they shared the project, also started an effective collaboration. The Memorandum of Understanding represents a fundamental step towards meeting the timetable for the realisation of an industrial plan that will mark an epoch-making step for our territory. The chosen location is certainly strategic, on the road axis leading from Italy to the centre of Europe. I am proud that this can go ahead”.

Elisabetta Piccoli, Deputy Mayor of the Municipality of Ivrea, added: “I have witnessed the birth of this very important project for our territory and the signing of the protocol makes me very happy because it represents a concrete action of synergy between the authorities that must proceed quickly alongside determined and courageous entrepreneurs like Lars Carlstrom. The increase of 3,000 jobs and the allied industries it would create is a goal we are all working towards together and in which we believe”.

“I believe I was the first mayor to meet Lars Carlstrom and Italvolt,” says Adriano Grassino, Mayor of the Municipality of Scarmagno. “I was struck by his determination and the project that he managed to get across in his words. The first question I asked him was about safety and the environment. The answer was comprehensive and immediate. He had already asked the question and found the solution by putting the issue at the forefront. Words were followed by deeds. The determination to proceed with the construction of the Gigafactory gradually took shape until the relevant entities agreed on the Memorandum of Understanding and the timetable, which is fundamental and indispensable for the construction of the industrial complex within a reasonable timeframe. An important and necessary project to restart the engine of the Canavese economy and the great and complex driving machine, the Piedmont Region. With Italvolt, Scarmagno would return to being one of the leading players in the national economy and perhaps even beyond its borders. A new and powerful boost would be given to employment and well-being in an exhausted area that absolutely needs it”.

“The Municipality of Romano Canavese”, commented Mayor Oscarino Ferrero, “considers the signing of the Memorandum of Understanding for the Italvolt Gigafactory to be an important moment for the development of a new economic reality and for the relaunch of the Canavese area which, despite having always been considered prosperous and home to large national companies, has recently suffered a loss of social and employment opportunities”.

In particular, given the significance and complexity of the project, the MoU provides for the establishment of a Technical Table of Coordination that will be chaired by a delegate of the Region with the task of coordinating and supporting the various institutional offices involved, with a view to efficient administrative action. In addition, considering the relevant public interest of the project and the timeframe for the start of production planned by Italvolt by 2024, the signatories are committed to make every reasonable effort to complete the procedure within seven months from the submission of the application, expected by June 2022.

The Piedmont Region, on behalf of all signatories, will also intensify the talks already started with the Ministry of Economic Development and other competent Ministries, in order to work alongside Italvolt in the identification of support and financing measures for the project, including those provided by the PNRR.

Italvolt itself adheres to the Memorandum of Understanding, as proponent of the initiative and the project. The Ivrea SUAP (Sportello unico attività produttive) is the body delegated to carry out the urban planning and building procedures related to the project and falling under the competence of the municipalities of Scarmagno and Romano Canavese.",https://www.italvolt.com/italvolt-signs-memorandum-of-understanding-for-the-gigafactory-of-scarmagno-and-romano-canavese-2/

Italvolt signs land purchase to build southern Europe’s largest gigafactory as EV battery cell plant race heats up,2023-12-19,"The Italian startup takes over the site of a former Olivette factory in the Piedmont region, where it plans to build a battery factory to help meet rising demand and production for electric vehicles.

Italvolt, a battery cell manufacturing startup, has agreed to a land purchase in Scarmagno, in the Piedmont region in Italy’s north west, which is set to become the site of one of the largest battery gigafactories planned in Europe.

Italvolt will purchase an area of around 1m sq.m from Prelios Sgr, manager of Fondo Monteverdi, at the site of a former factory of Olivetti, an Italian telecoms group.

“The agreement with Prelios Sgr represents a crucial step in the implementation plan of our gigafactory project,” said Lars Carlstrom, CEO and founder of Italvolt. “We are delighted to have concluded the purchase of the land with input from local authorities. In recent months they have made a significant contribution to the promotion of Italvolt’s project. The decommissioned site offers excellent potential to restore the local industrial heritage, offering jobs and environmental improvements.”

Italvolt has ambitions for capacity at the site to eventually reach 45 gigawatt hours (GWh) per year. The company expects to invest a total of around €3.4 billion ($4 billion).

“We are certain that this will pave the way for new industrial initiatives dedicated to battery production,” added Carlstrom. “To achieve the challenging goal, set by the European Commission, to complete the transition towards a zero-emission automotive industry by 2035, it is necessary to accelerate battery production, and Italvolt is ready to do its part.”

The Scarmagno site was selected as it already contains existing infrastructure and strategic geographical location for road and rail connections. Around 300,000 sq.m will be reclaimed and repurposed for constructing the new plant, and 20,000 sq.m will be used for a research and development centre.

Italvolt also hopes the site will be able to use Piedmont’s manufacturing capabilities, as it is the leading region in Italy for automotive industrial production, including R&D and manufacturing capabilities for major automotive and industrial brands in and near to Turin, including Fiat, Maserati, Pininfarina and CNH Industrial.

Italvolt confirmed that it received federal and local government support, but no funding, for the site in February 2021.

Italvolt expects to acquire building permits by the beginning of 2022, so construction can begin in the second half of the year. The gigafactory factory is scheduled for completion in 2024.

Italvolt has partnered with Pininfarina’s Architecture Division to design the plant. According to Pininfarina, it plans to develop a new generation industrial plant integrated into the region’s economic and social fabric, with focus on environmental and social impact.

Lars Carlstrom had previously founded UK gigafactory startup Britishvolt, before stepping down from the company in December 2020.

Battery gigafactory investment is on the rise in Europe and other regions. According to Daniel Harisson, automotive analyst at Automotive from Ultima Media, global capacity for lithium-ion battery production capacity will rise from 475 GWh in 2020 to more than 2,850 GWh by 2030. Europe will see some of the most investment and capacity expansion, expected to rise from 60 GWh in 2020 to more than 950 GWh by 2030, in an effort to localise supply to meet OEM and government targets for electrification.

Italvolt’s gigafactory is set to be one of several that will be built in southern Europe, where currently there is virtually no capacity. The Volkswagen Group has said at least one of six new gigafactories it plans to build will be in southern Europe.
