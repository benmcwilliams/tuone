Tesla to get €1.14Bn in state funding for Berlin battery plant,2021-09-06 00:00:00,"Tesla may receive 1.135 billion euros for its planned battery cell production in Grünheide near Berlin from the German Ministry of Economics and Technology (BMVi). Local media reports quote new data such as expected job creation and Tesla’s own commitment.

The total investment volume could be around five billion euros, the Tagesspiegel newspaper reports following a ministerial publication. The BMWi, in addition, considers “a figure of 2,000 or more jobs in the battery area of the Grünheide plant to be realistic,” when talking to Tagesspiegel, thus making funding worthwhile.

At the same time, Tesla has not confirmed how much it will invest in the battery plant planned to sit next to Giga Berlin. The BMWi suggests the five billion euros to be an “estimate of the perspective total investment” projected in the additional information for the funding program. Earlier targets mentioned by Tesla CEO Elon Musk set the cell factory’s capacity at over 100 GWh in the longer term.

More factors speak to the information being correct. For example, take the BMVi only last week granting funding to the ACC joint venture following a successful bid for the first Battery IPCEI. As a result, 437 million in state funding was handed over for a battery cell plant in Kaiserslautern. At the same time, the companies involved (PSA, Opel and Saft) will invest around 2 billion euros in the factory. This funding ratio of around 1:4.5 matches the now suggested ratio for Tesla.

Tesla is also one of eleven companies bidding in the second Battery IPCEI. Should the company receive over one billion euros, as mentioned, one-third of the second IPCEI funding of 2.9 billion euros would flow to Tesla.

However, nothing has been confirmed. The process is not yet complete, and the BMWI told Tagesspiegel. They added that “prior to the grant notice,” no information on the funding amount can be provided either. “The issuance of the notice is currently being intensively prepared and is planned for the 4th quarter of 2021,” the ministry said. In earlier communications, the BMVi mentioned six of eleven projects being underway.

Tesla, in June, had amended the planning documents for Grünheide to include a battery cell production facility on-site. While not unusual for projects of that scope, the amendments are undergoing approval again which has proven difficult so far for the electric carmaker. In the third public approval procedure, 395 new objections were reportedly raised, bringing the total up to 809 and now requiring another public hearing.

Due to the difficulties, Tesla Model Y production is on hold at Giga Berlin, but the Californians remain positive to resume production before the year’s end as planned. Once running at capacity, the Tesla plant in Grünheide is to make about half a million electric cars a year.

Tesla reveals plan for Gigafactory Berlin expansion with battery production and more,2023-07-19 00:00:00,"Tesla has revealed its plan for Gigafactory Berlin expansion with battery production and more, as it seeks approval for the plan.

Gigafactory Berlin is Tesla’s first full-scale factory in Europe.

It is now producing over 5,000 Model Y vehicles per week, but the automaker always had much bigger plans for the factory.

Tesla is currently approved for the production of 500,000 cars per year at the plant.

Now the automaker has submitted plans for a significant expansion that would allow for the production of 1 million vehicles per year and 100 GWh of battery production.

Here are the new plans for Tesla Gigafactory Berlin:

The new plan also includes a water recycling facility, a new logistics area, more battery storage, solar roof, and something called “solar roof charging.”

The new expansion would happen in three stages with the first one being operational in the first half of 2024 if it is approved.

However, Tesla has had some delays in receiving approval the first time around and the same could happen again.",https://electrek.co/2023/07/19/tesla-reveals-plan-gigafactory-berlin-expansion-battery-production/
Tesla plans to invest $8 billion into EV battery plant next to Giga Berlin,2021-09-07 00:00:00,"Tesla will invest up to 5 billion euros ($A8 billion) in a lithium-ion battery plant at “Giga Berlin”, with a decision on whether the German government will tip in 1 billion towards it expected by the end of 2021.

German media stories say that a new publication by the Federal Ministry of Economics (BMWi) provides new information on the costs of the battery factory that Tesla is planning on the site of its Gigafactory in Grünheide near Berlin.

Tesla CEO and co-founder Elon Musk flagged the Berlin battery factory at a conference in 2020, saying it would eventually be one of the largest battery plants in the world with 250GWh capacity.

The Germany ministry of economic reportedly gave the EV maker the green light to start making preparations in early 2021, with the project ruled eligible for the European Union’s 2.9 billion euro ($A4.58 billion) European Battery Innovation project.

Shortly after this announcement in January, it was reported that one billion euro of the German share was earmarked for Tesla, which the German ministry initially did not confirm.

Teslamag.de now reports that the ministry’s monthly report “Economic Policy Highlights ” now shows that Tesla wants to invest around 5 billion euros in cell production.

It is the single largest investment in battery manufacture currently being planned in Germany, where 21 billion euros in battery factory investment – almost half of all Europe’s 46 million euros total – is planned.

According to reports, Tesla will receive 1.135 billion euros in state funding for the development of its German battery production, the Tagesspiegel wrote without citing the source.

The ministry was quoted by Teslamag.de as saying that information on the amount could only be given when the funding decision was handed over. That is planned for the fourth quarter of this year.

There are more than 70 electric vehicles now available in Germany according to BMWi, and every fourth car sold is a plug-in electric vehicle.

In the first half of 2021, Volkswagen sold more than 38,000 electric e-Up! and ID.3s, while Tesla sold more than 13,000 Model 3s.",https://thedriven.io/2021/09/07/tesla-plans-to-invest-8-billion-into-ev-battery-plant-next-to-giga-berlin/
Tesla (TSLA) could get over $1 billion in government funding for battery factory at Gigafactory Berlin,2021-09-06 00:00:00,"The German government is finalizing a subsidy package that could give Tesla (TSLA) over $1 billion in government funding for its new battery factory at Gigafactory Berlin.

After announcing plans to build a large electric vehicle factory in Berlin, Tesla confirmed that the project will also include a large battery cell factory.

It would likely become Tesla’s first in-house volume production of battery cells.

Around the same time that Tesla made the announcement, the German government announced plans to invest billions of dollars in encouraging local battery cell production to support local electric vehicle manufacturing.

Last year, we learned that Tesla applied for that government support.

Now, Germany’s Tagesspiegel newspaper reports that Tesla could be the biggest beneficiary of the new program and secure as much as 1.14 billion euros ($1.35 billion USD).

According to the report, they came up with the amount due to the number of jobs that Tesla plans to create at the factory, which could add up to 2,000.

Tagesspiegel reported (translated from German):

In Tesla’s new battery factory in Germany, by which the gigafactory for electric cars in Grünheide near Berlin is being expanded, significantly more jobs are to be created than previously known. The Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (BMWI) , headed by Peter Altmaier (CDU), considers, as it explained to Tagesspiegel’s request, “with product and production success a number of 2000 or more jobs in the battery area of ​​the plant in Grünheide is realistic”.

This is apparently signficantly more than in any other application.

It’s also not clear how much Tesla plans to spend specifically on the new battery factory, but the automaker has previously indicated plans to spend as much as $5 billion on Gigafactory Berlin and employ over 10,000 at the factory.

The new factory would become Tesla’s new production hub in Europe and supply EVs for local European demand.

The government is expected to make a decision on Tesla’s application by the end of the year.

Tesla has recently indicated plans to start production of the Model Y at Gigafactory Berlin in October.",https://electrek.co/2021/09/06/tesla-tsla-over-1-billion-govt-funding-for-battery-factory-gigafactory-berlin/
Tesla Berlin gigafactory launch hailed as “model” for investment projects in Germany,2022-03-22 13:22:32+01:00,"Tesla has opened its first European e-car production hub with the gigafactory near Germany’s capital Berlin, shaking up the industry in the birthplace of the internal combustion engine. Tesla head Elon Musk handed over the first electric cars produced at the site to clients. Musk had invited top-level government representatives such as chancellor Olaf Scholz and economy minister Robert Habeck to the opening ceremony, who hailed the speed of the factory's planning and construction.

With a view to the comparatively short construction time of two years, chancellor Olaf Scholz said: ""Germany can be fast,"" reported public broadcaster rbb. In a message on Twitter he called the opening an ""important sign"" that shows Germany is ""a strong location for industrial investment. This is how we will succeed in becoming climate neutral and lead the transformation. The future belongs to electromobility.""

Start of production at the gigafactory is a crucial day for the mobility transition in Germany, said economy and climate minister Robert Habeck at the factory. ""The path towards electromobility is another step away from oil imports,"" he added, making a connection to the current energy supply debates following the invasion of Ukraine. Russia's war against Ukraine has forced Germany and the EU to radically rethink their energy policy, given that the continent is heavily dependent on Russian fossil fuels. Handelsblatt quoted Habeck as saying: “To show we can not only replace oil with oil, but we can electrify, is of course a beautiful symbol on this day.”

The arrival of Tesla's ""gigafactory"" near Berlin has sparked a lot of debate in the past two years. It is set to churn out hundreds of thousands of electric cars in the birth country of the combustion engine. The plant will shake up the car industry in Germany and Europe, and accelerate regional development, as well as the shift to electric mobility.",https://www.cleanenergywire.org/news/tesla-berlin-gigafactory-launch-hailed-model-investment-projects-germany
