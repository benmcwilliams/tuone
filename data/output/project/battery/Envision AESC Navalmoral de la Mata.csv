US: Envision AESC Targets 70 GWh/Year Of Battery Manufacturing Capacity,2022-10-26,"Envision AESC confirmed a second large EV battery gigafactory project in the US this year, towards its target to increase annual manufacturing capacity to 70 GWh (and 300+ GWh globally).

The latest investment is a dedicated 30 GWh battery plant in South Carolina, which will produce cylindrical lithium-ion battery cells for the BMW Group's Plant Spartanburg. Those are BMW's sixth-generation battery cells with a standard diameter of 46 mm (similar to Tesla) - see more details here.

According to Envision AESC, the company is currently working to finalize a suitable site close to BMW Group’s vehicle production and battery assembly facilities.

We guess that once the company will secure a plot, we will get some more details.

Envision AESC (formerly AESC - Nissan and NEC's JV - acquired by the Envision Group in 2019, in which Nissan - as far as we know - still holds a 20% share) is a battery arm of global green tech company Envision Group.

The new battery gigafactory in South Carolina will come on top of the battery gigafactory in Bowling Green, Kentucky, which was announced in April 2022. The factory in Kentucky also will have an output of 30 GWh per year (although with an option for 40 GWh/year). The type of battery cells might be different, since the customers will be different.

Envision AESC also has a small facility at the Nissan manufacturing site in Smyrna, Tennessee, US (probably only 3.0 GWh per year, according to previous reports).

Global expansion

Envision AESC is quickly expanding its manufacturing capabilities with new plants in Japan (up to 18 GWh/year), UK (up to 38 GWh/year), France (30 GWh/year ""or more"" by 2029), Spain (up to 50 GWh/year) and in China (a few plants).

All those projects combined indicate that the former Nissan's joint venture AESC is going big under the Chinese Envision Group.

Envision Group to lead development of battery gigafactory in Extremadura,,"The Envision Group has presented plans for the production of electric vehicle batteries, and for which it has applied for funding from the Strategic Projects for Economic Recovery and Transformation for Electric and Connected Vehicles (PERTE VEC). The Chinese company heads a consortium of twelve companies which will be established in nine autonomous communities.

Extremadura will however be the nerve centre of the Venergy+ project. Envision will construct a battery gigafactory in Navalmoral de la Mata (Cáceres). The decision was made after several months of negotiations with the Spanish Government and with the support of the Regional Government of Extremadura, which has provided 200 hectares of land for development.



Promoting electric mobility

Venergy+ is not just a battery manufacturing project. Its aim is to generate an integrated ecosystem for promoting electric mobility. As well as the Asian company, which has ten battery factories in Japan, the US, the United Kingdom, China and France, the role of Acciona stands out among its partners, being responsible for the solar power plant that will be built alongside the gigafatory to supply clean energy.



The twelve partners will launch sixteen primary projects in total, ranging from battery production and renewable energy supply to the development of digital solutions. Together with the Envision Group, Venergy+ is made up of Acciona Generación Renovables, Acciona Silence, Teknia, the Galicia Automotive Technology Centre (CTAG), Aresar, Liux, Qalma, Glavista, Cable Energía and Kapture.IO.



Zero emission factory

The planned investment to launch Venergy+ is one billion euros. The star of the project is the construction of the battery gigafactory at Navalmoral de la Mata, which involves an investment of 900 million euros, and creating employment for around 3,000 people from 2025. This will be a zero emission factory because it will be powered by the on-site solar power plant to be installed by Acciona in three phases of 10 GW each, until reaching its planned target of 30 GW by 2030.



The cells, modules and high-performance battery packs produced at this gigafactory will be integrated into the different electrical platforms by using a removable battery system and adapted to models ranging from vans and heavy trucks to a new electric vehicle for last mile delivery, three modular electric vehicles and a light, electric two-wheel vehicle.



R&D collaboration

As well as promoting decarbonisation, this project contributes to the industrial renewal of the automotive sector in Spain, Europe’s second largest vehicle producer. It also encourages collaborative R&D across the entire battery life cycle, from storage to reuse, with smart charging and closed loop recycling.



According to the president of the Envision Group in Spain, José Domínguez Abascal, “Envision is very grateful to the Government of Spain and the Regional Government of Extremadura for the level of support they have shown to get us to this important point. We welcome this enduring strategic partnership and our shared ambition and cooperation, which will continue as we develop this and other projects together.”



Thousands of green jobs

Regarding the establishment of the consortium, Domínguez Abascal explained, “We are connecting large traditional companies with SMEs and start-ups, each of which make a unique contribution to the decarbonisation, growth and renewal of Spain and generate thousands of high-value green jobs for the future.”

Envision AESC to Build a Power Battery Factory in Spain with a Planned Capacity of 30GWh,2022-06-07,"SHANGHAI, Jun 7 (SMM) - Envision AESC will invest in the construction of a large power battery factory in the Navalmoral de la Mata, Spain, with a planned production capacity of 30GWh, which is scheduled to be completed and put into operation in 2025.

Spain is the second largest automobile producer in Europe. Influenced by the electric transformation of automobiles and the strategy of carbon neutrality, Spain is actively promoting the development of the power battery and electric vehicle industry to become a new European electric vehicle industry centre.

According to Envision AESC, the new factory in Spain will provide higher quality, longer cruising range, more cost competitive, cleaner and low-carbon power battery products for the global leading car companies. However, Envision AESC did not disclose which international car company it cooperated with. It is worth noting that Envision AESC has reached long-term strategic cooperation with many international car companies such as Renault, Nissan, Daimler and Honda.

As the most internationalised Chinese battery company, Envision AESC has successively laid out a number of large-scale power battery production/R&D bases in China, Japan, Britain, France and the US. The new factory landing in Spain is another important layout for its global development.

It is reported that the super factory will realise 100% renewable energy supply and carbon neutral operation by relying on the zero-carbon system solution of Envision AESC. At the same time, Envision AESC will open up the construction of a local battery ecosystem in Spain, and promote the innovation and development of intelligent charging facilities, battery recycling and other life cycle technologies. This project is also a key project supported by the Spanish government's “Strategic Projects for Economic Recovery and Transformation (PERTE-VEC)”.

With the planning and construction of this new factory, Envision AESC has planned and laid out 11 battery production bases in China, Japan, the US, Britain, France and Spain. In 2026, its total production capacity of zero-carbon batteries will exceed 300GWh. It has laid out three production bases in China:

Wuxi, Erdos, and Shiyan. The planned production capacity of the Wuxi base is 20GWh, the first phase project 5GWh has been completed and put into operation in 2021, and the second phase project started in February this year with a planned production capacity of 15GWh, which will be completed and put into operation in 2023. Ordos battery manufacturing base started construction in 2021, with a total planned production capacity of 20GWh, of which the first phase project was completed and put into operation in April 2022. The project in Hubei started in February this year. It is reported that a production line of the high power battery production project is planned to be put into production before the end of this year.

It has two battery production bases in Japan. The Kanagawa base is constructed with a production capacity of 2.6GWh. In August 2021, its second battery factory of landed in Ibarakiken, Japan, with a planned capacity of 18GWh.

In the UK, Envision AESC already has built a battery factory with an annual production capacity of 1.9GWh in Sunderland. In July 2021, the company planned to build a power battery super factory in the UK, with a planned capacity of 25GWh, and it has a capacity expansion potential of 35GWh.

In France, in June 2021, Envision AESC announced the construction of a super battery factory in Duet, with a planned production capacity of 24GWh, and the expansion potential of 40GWh.

In the US, Envision AESC’s first factory is located in Tennessee and has been put into operation. In April 2022, Envision AESC announced the construction of a new power battery super factory in Kentucky, with a planned production capacity of 30GWh and the expansion potential of 40GWh.

Envision AESC gets long-term orders from many international car companies, which supports it to make the large-scale layout of battery factories in many places around the world. Since last year, Envision AESC has continued to reach strategic cooperation with a number of leading car companies to devote to the global transportation zero-carbon transformation. In June 2021, Envision AESC reached strategic cooperation with Renault; In July of the same year, it deepened the strategic cooperation with Nissan; In March 2022, it reached strategic cooperation with Mercedes-Benz.",https://news.metal.com/newscontent/101853886/Envision-AESC-to-Build-a-Power-Battery-Factory-in-Spain-with-a-Planned-Capacity-of-30GWh/
Envision AESC is building another battery plant in Spain,2022-07-19 00:00:00,"Envision AESC is now also planning a battery cell factory in Spain. This is part of a larger strategic agreement between the Envision Group and the Spanish government. The battery factory is to be built in the Spanish city of Navalmoral de la Mata and will be operational in 2025 with a capacity of up to 50 GWh.

The overall project includes a gigafactory for batteries, a digital net-zero centre, a green hydrogen plant and an assembly plant for smart wind turbines in different regions in Spain, according to Envision. The battery factory is planned in Navalmoral de la Mata in the Extremadura region of western Spain. Navalmoral de la Mata is located about halfway from the capital Madrid to the Spanish-Portuguese border.

Like Volkswagen’s battery factory in Sagunt near Valencia, the Envision AESC plant is to be subsidised through Spain’s PERTE programme. In return, the battery factory will become part of the “VENERGY+” project, which consists of 12 partners from ten autonomous communities in Spain, according to the announcement. It will localise the supply of vehicle parts and components using advanced technologies and integrate them into the battery ecosystem. The possible funding amount is not mentioned in the announcement.

The battery factory is expected to create up to 3,000 jobs. Envision AESC does not give any further details in the announcement – it is primarily about the overall project. More precise time schedules, the type of battery cells produced there and also possible customers are therefore not yet known.

On the other hand, it is certain that the plant for the production of green hydrogen will be built in the central Spanish region of Castilla-La Mancha – here, too, there are no details yet on the timetable or the exact scope of the plant. Plants for the assembly of smart wind turbines are also to be built in Castilla and the Leon region in the north-west of the country.

“We are fully committed to supporting Spain’s national agenda on net zero transition,” says Envision CEO Lei Zhang. “The creation of new industrial opportunities such as the Net Zero Industrial Park will unlock the vast potential of renewable energy in Spain and serve as a gateway to building a pan-European greentech industrial ecosystem.”

The battery factory in Spain joins Envision AESC’s growing list of battery projects: in China, the company is building a battery plant with an annual capacity of 20 GWh. A joint battery factory with Nissan in Japan was announced in August 2021. Plans for factories in Sunderland, UK and Douai, France (including for Renault and Nissan plants there) were last adjusted in 2021. Finally, this April, the construction of a US battery factory in Kentucky was announced.

China's Envision proposes EV battery giga-factory in Spain,,"Chinese green technology company Envision Group has formed a consortium with 11 entities to lead the development of a EUR-1-billion (USD 1.07bn) electric vehicle (EV) battery plant in Spain’s region of Extremadura.

The project VENERGY+ is imagined as a 100% decarbonised giga-factory in the town of Navalmoral de la Mata that will manufacture high performance battery cells, modules and packs with extended range and increased density, Envision said. In the first phase, the giga-factory will have a capacity of 10 GWh, which the group expects to raise to 30 GWh by 2030.

Spanish renewables company Acciona Energia (BME:ANE), a member of the consortium via two business units, will supply electricity to the plant from an on-site solar farm.

The VENERGY+ partnership has applied for funding from the so-called PERTE VEC, the Spanish government’s financing instrument aimed supporting EVs and connected vehicles with EU rescue funds.

The proposed battery plant could be operational in 2025. Envision, which is working on the project through its battery technology unit Envision AESC, expects the project to create some 3,000 new jobs from then on, it said.

The VENERGY+ project will include the factory and the supporting ecosystem. According to Envision, the initiative will span 16 primary projects spanning ten regions of Spain. Besides Envision and Acciona, the consortium includes Teknia, the Automotive Technology Centre of Galicia (CTAG), Aresar, Liux, Qalma, Glavista, Cable Energía and Kapture.IO.

Spain to support Seat and Envision battery factories,2023-09-19 00:00:00,"Envision holds a grant of 200 million euros and a loan of another 100 million euros for its planned battery cell factory in Navalmoral de la Mata. The project was announced in July 2022, with a production start in 2025 as the target. When completed, the plant is expected to produce 50 GWh of battery cells per year.

Seat is being subsidised to the tune of 47 million euros to build a battery assembly plant at its Martorell plant near Barcelona. However, as announced this summer, Seat will manufacture supplied battery cells there into ready-to-install battery packs for vehicle production. The cells are to come from the Volkswagen battery factory in Sagunt near Valencia, the construction of which started in March.

VW had announced an investment of 300 million euros for the plant at production hall 10. With 47 million euros, the Spanish government is thus covering just under one-sixth of the sum. At Envision, the total investment is over 1.3 billion euros. With a total of 300 million euros consisting of the grant and loan, this results in a subsidy rate of around 23 per cent.",https://www.electrive.com/2023/09/19/spain-to-support-seat-and-envision-battery-factories/
Renault may get battery cells made in Spain from China’s AESC,2023-11-23 00:00:00,"The Spanish portal La Tribuna de Automoción reports that talks are said to be at an advanced stage. AESC (formerly Envision AESC) is planning a cell factory in Navalmoral de la Mata (Cáceres) set to go into operation in 2025 with a capacity of up to 50 GWh. The Chinese battery cell firm has reportedly already signed a contract to supply battery cells to the Spanish Mercedes-Benz Vans plant in Vitoria, which, as is known, will become one of the global production sites for electric vans based on the new VAN.EA platform from 2026. With the Renault Group, AESC now has another major customer in prospect.

The report thus suggests that Renault also wants to build purely electric cars at its Spanish plants in Valladolid and Palencia in the future – which has yet to be confirmed but is evident given the general electric plans. However, Renault denied this when La Tribuna de Automoción asked for comment.

The Renault Captur (also as a PHEV) is currently being built in Valladolid, where the Twizy was assembled until 2019. The Palencia plant produces the Kadjar SUV and the fourth-gen Mégane – the combustion model will continue to be offered. However, the fifth generation of the Mégane built in France with a purely electric drive is already on the market.

What’s more, the two companies are already working together. In France, AESC is building a battery cell factory at Renault’s French site in Douai, as reported. Following a redesign (the plant is being built on a car park next to the Renault plant instead of a wooded area), this will be smaller than initially announced but will be scaled up to an annual production of at least 30 GWh by 2029.

And Renault needs more cells. The new electric division Ampere is planning seven electric models by 2031, of which around one million vehicles will be produced each year. Renault and Ampere have reportedly secured battery cells for 600,000 electric cars for the French plants. This means they require cells for another 400,000 electric vehicles.

According to the report in La Tribuna de Automoción, AESC is conducting further negotiations with “several brands”, in addition to the talks with Renault, to supply battery cells to other European plants as well.
