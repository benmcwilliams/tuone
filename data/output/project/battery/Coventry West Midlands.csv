Battery maker close to deal for Coventry gigafactory,2023-10-11 00:00:00,"Planning consent has already been secured for £2.5bn factory on land at Coventry Airport

The West Midlands Gigafactory joint venture has revealed it is in advanced talks with several leading Asian battery manufacturers to build a factory in Coventry.

Planning consent was secured last year for the land at Coventry Airport to construct a £2.5bn lithium-ion battery production facility.

The West Midlands Gigafactory’s Coventry location is the only available site in the UK with planning permission in place for such a large-scale battery production facility with capacity for up to 60GWh per annum – enough to power 600,000 electric vehicles.

Cllr Jim O’Boyle, Cabinet Member for Jobs, Regeneration and Climate Change at Coventry City Council, said: “The West Midlands Gigafactory site in Coventry is a prime location offering future investors an all-in-one solution for battery manufacturing, research, industrialisation and recycling. In addition, we are well-positioned to become an Investment Zone, which will deliver significant additional tax incentives and breaks for future investors.

“I’m pleased to report that we are now in advanced discussions with leading Asian battery manufacturers who want to develop a presence in the UK.

“We hope, with the support of the UK Government, that we will secure an investor and further strengthen our region’s leadership credentials in the shift towards electrification.”

In recognition of the strategic importance of this project, an unprecedented regional incentives package will be available to the eventual occupier.

This is expected to create favourable conditions for local taxation and access to clean, sustainable power that a world-class battery facility requires.",https://www.constructionenquirer.com/2023/10/11/battery-maker-close-to-deal-for-coventry-gigafactory/
Battery manufacturers in 'advanced talks' about Coventry gigafactory investment,2023-10-12,"COVENTRY’S proposed West Midlands Gigafactory could be about to take a big step forward as it has been revealed the joint venture is in ‘advanced talks’ with several Asian battery manufacturers about future investment at the site.

The Coventry site is the only one available in the UK with planning permission for a large-scale battery production facility with enough to power 600,000 electric vehicles.

At the Labour Party Conference on Monday, Coventry City Council’s cabinet member for jobs, regeneration and climate change, Coun Jim O’Boyle, said he hoped with UK Government support the project would secure an investor.

He added: “The West Midlands Gigafactory site in Coventry is a prime location offering future investors an all-in-one solution for battery manufacturing, research, industrialisation and recycling. “In addition, we are well-positioned to become an Investment Zone, which will deliver significant additional tax incentives and breaks for future investors. “I’m pleased to report that we are now in advanced discussions with leading Asian battery manufacturers who want to develop a presence in the UK.”



The West Midlands Gigafactory could create up to 6,000 new jobs as well as protect and create tens of thousands more in the automotive supply chain.

"West Midlands Gigafactory, the largest in the UK, to secure the British automotive industry's long-term electric future – Coventry City Council",2021-10-21,"A public/private joint venture between the Council and Coventry Airport Ltd, today unveiled further plans to develop the UK’s largest battery Gigafactory as it explores investment opportunities with battery manufacturers from around the globe.

Located in the epicentre of the UK’s automotive industry, the Gigafactory will begin supplying high-tech batteries for electric vehicles from 2025. It will be the result of a £2.5bn investment, creating up to 6,000 new highly skilled jobs directly and thousands more in the wider supply chain in Coventry and the surrounding region.

This strategically crucial investment is an imperative for the UK’s electrified future, especially for the automotive industry which will stop producing petrol and diesel engines from 2030.

The new Gigafactory, which will command over half a million square metres of space – equivalent to 74 full-size football pitches, will be one of the largest single industry facilities of any kind in the UK and at full capacity will be capable of delivering up to 60GWh of production per year.

It will be powered by a planned major boost to the local energy network, giving the Gigafactory access to a 100% renewable electricity supply, from a combination of solar power and grid-supplied renewables. The West Midlands Gigafactory will be able to recycle used batteries as well as build new ones in an industry leading approach known as “cradle to cradle.”

Mike Murray, West Midlands Gigafactory Project Director “The West Midlands Gigafactory has a singular mission to create a state-of-the-art battery gigafactory in the heart of the UK automotive industry. It will provide a huge cash investment in the area, leading to thousands of well-paid jobs and creating crucial new skills for this country.

“The Coventry Airport site is perfectly located to do just that, being ideally positioned to supply the UK’s leading automotive manufacturers who need access to world-class batteries on their doorsteps. We need to make these advanced lithium-ion batteries where we make cars and there is no better place than in the West Midlands.”

Cllr Jim O’Boyle, Cabinet Member for Jobs, Regeneration and Climate Change said: “Coventry is the historical home of the automotive industry in the UK, where much of the cutting-edge technology that defined the global car industry last century was created here in our city. Now, as we stand at the dawn of a new electric age, we fully intend for Coventry to be very front of the green industrial revolution which will power the future of the automotive industry.

“The West Midlands Gigafactory is a unique public private sector joint venture between Coventry City Council and Coventry Airport Ltd, supported by an alliance of local governments, industrial groups and universities. It will provide a huge amount of certainty to our automotive industry, as well as providing much needed jobs and investment to our region. This project puts Coventry at the heart of the British battery industry, giving it access to the region’s world-class skills, R&D and supply chain capabilities.”

Andy Street, West Midlands Mayor “From securing the future of our region’s automotive industry and the huge economic and job creation that would bring, to helping protect our planet from the climate change emergency, a West Midlands Gigafactory would be a complete game-changer for our region – and we are making it happen.

“By submitting our planning application earlier this year, and now answering the difficult question around power supply and renewable energy, we are doing what we can to be able to get the site operational ASAP once a commercial negotiation between supplier and customer concludes.

“The West Midlands is already home to the country’s biggest car manufacturer, Europe’s largest research centre of its kind, the UK’s only battery industrialisation centre, and a world-leading supply chain. A Gigafactory therefore is the natural next step for the UK’s automotive heartland, and, working in partnership with industry and the Government, we will not rest until we have secured one.”

Based at Coventry Airport, the Gigafactory will be adjacent to the UK Battery Industrialisation Centre, part of the UK’s Faraday Challenge. The Centre provides a critical link between research at laboratory or prototype stages and the successful mass production of new battery technologies

These links will be hugely important to the future development of the Gigafactory in the West Midlands.

Margot James, Executive Chair at WMG, University of Warwick comments ""The West Midlands is already home to 28% of the UK's automotive sector talent, with an established skills ecosystem and supply chain.

“The proposed Gigafactory will bring a wealth of opportunities and high skilled jobs to the region. WMG is a centre of excellence for battery technology research and development alongside UKBIC, making the region a natural home for the proposed Gigafactory.""

West Midlands Gigafactory has support from a unique alliance of West Midlands industrial groups, local government and academic institutions. This alliance includes the West Midlands Combined Authority, Warwick District Council, Warwickshire County Council, Rugby Council, Warwick Manufacturing Group at University of Warwick, Coventry University and the Manufacturing Technology Centre.

Coventry Airport was first opened in 1936 by Coventry City Council which continues to own the freehold of the site. It operated as RAF Baginton during the Second World War and commercial passenger flights were subsequently reinstated until 2009. Rigby Group plc acquired the long leasehold in 2010 and it remains in its ownership.

Coventry Gigafactory targets 60 GWh capacity,2021-10-21 00:00:00,"West Midlands Gigafactory, the public-private joint venture between Coventry City Council and Coventry Airport Ltd, has revealed more targets for the envisioned battery production hub. Their pitch now includes a 60-GWh output with production to start in 2025, but one issue remains.

+ + Kindly see our update below + +

The plans to install a Gigafactory scale battery production in the West Midlands are not new. The city, the metropolitan region and the airport had published corresponding plans earlier this year before submitting the planning application in July. At the time, the West Midlands Gigafactory joint venture was still looking for “experienced partners” and, ultimately, investors to move into the strategically located hub.

Today’s announcement suggests said search continues. “The UK’s largest battery Gigafactory continues to explore investment opportunities with battery manufacturers from around the globe,” so the initiators.

Meanwhile, West Midlands Gigafactory is not shy to bolster the pitch. The latest announcement confirms previous targets, i.e. a nearly half a million square metre site or the creation of 6,000 jobs. The JV also sticks with the envisioned start of production in 2025 and now add the ambitious capacity of 60 GWh. As a comparison, the confirmed battery factory Envision AESC is building near Nissan in Sunderland will initially have an annual capacity of six GWh. Later, capacity could be increased to between 18 and 20 GWh.

The question remains – who will build the new facility the West Midlands are hoping for? In Coventry, the joint venture boldly states that the facility would result from a £2.5bn investment (about three billion euros). Money it has yet to attract, it appears. In the announcement, Coventry City Council and Coventry Airport Ltd mention support of a “unique alliance of local governments, industrial groups, and universities.” The partner section on the website reveals academic and governmental partners indeed. However, manufacturers appear to remain missing. Only an earlier report in the Guardian newspaper had suggested InoBat Auto being considered as a partner, but this remains unconfirmed.

At the same time, the region is at the heart of Britain’s remaining automotive industry. The area around Coventry is home to several car manufacturers, including Jaguar Land Rover and Aston Martin Lagonda, BMW, and LEVC. The joint venture thus considers the battery plant a “strategically crucial investment” and an “imperative for the UK’s electrified future, especially for the automotive industry which will stop producing petrol and diesel engines from 2030.”

While the industrial investment has yet to materialise, it is well known that the UK is aiming to install battery production capacity on the Isles. The government in June appeared in talks with six manufacturers to build giga-scales factories and this week updated its Net Zero strategy. It now envisions not only the ban of ICE sales in 2030 the JV is referring to above but will likely include an EV sales quota for manufacturers from 2024, making supply an even more urgent matter.

Earlier news also reported the UK government promising up to £500 million (around €573 million) in stimulus funding for a Gigafactory in the UK. “In due course”, the initiators from the West Midlands announced at the time.

And investment may come. Currently, there is only one other concrete initiative to build a battery factory at Giga scale in the UK: Britishvolt has secured the rights to a site in Blyth near the Nissan plant in Sunderland, but also still has to secure financing to start construction.

Update 14 January 2022:

The UK joint venture West Midlands Gigafactory is one step closer to its planned battery cell factory at Coventry Airport. The planning committees of Coventry City Council and Warwick District Council have now decided to approve outline plans for the factory. The target remains for the factory to be ready for production in 2025.

Project manager Mike Murray said: “With outline planning permission supported, the site has everything in place that future investors, likely to be drawn from the global battery industry, need for a state-of-the-art Gigafactory.” He added, “Thanks to this decision, we are now in a strong position to progress our discussions with the global automotive and energy storage industries.”

Britishvolt gets £100m boost to build UK’s first large-scale ‘gigafactory’,2022-01-21 00:00:00,"The UK government will invest £100m in Britishvolt as the car battery manufacturing startup seeks to build Britain’s first large-scale “gigafactory” in the north-east of England.

The government’s Automotive Transformation Fund will invest alongside asset management company Abrdn and its majority-owned property investment arm, Tritax, to fund a sale and leaseback deal for the huge building that will house the electric car battery factory, near Blyth in Northumberland.

Peter Rolton, Britishvolt’s executive chairman, said: “The UK automotive industry needs a local source of batteries. Chinese or other Asian imports are not going to be an option. There will be very, very significant shortfalls of batteries. We are absolutely vital to maintain the UK industry and support those jobs.”

Britishvolt is one of two major UK battery manufacturing projects that has secured funding, alongside an expansion of an existing plant at Sunderland owned by China’s Envision that supplies to Nissan.

The company is hoping to build the plant rapidly with the aim of supplying a large part of the UK car industry’s needs as it transitions from internal combustion engines to electric cars that produce zero exhaust emissions. It is in talks with several potential clients, and sportscar maker Lotus has signed a memorandum of understanding, Bloomberg reported on Thursday.

The plant will employ about 3,000 workers when it is at full capacity in around 2028. The first batteries are scheduled to start production in 2024 to take advantage of rising demand ahead of the UK’s 2030 ban on new cars without a battery.

The government and Britishvolt declined to detail the size of the government investment, citing commercial confidentiality. However, a source with knowledge of the negotiations said it was worth about £100m.

The government-funded Advanced Propulsion Centre calculates that the UK will need to produce batteries with a capacity of 90 gigawatt hours (GWh) a year if it is to retain a car industry of a similar size. Current UK production capacity is less than 2GWh, but Britishvolt hopes to produce 30GWh.

Local authorities in the West Midlands and Somerset are trying to attract investors to two more potential battery manufacturing sites. The West Midlands site at Coventry airport last week gained pre-emptive planning permission.

Rolton said: “The company was still working on the timing of a planned stock market listing which will raise the money to build the production line. The full project is expected to cost £3.8bn, but the government backing has already helped in conversations with potential investors.”

Britishvolt has previously won backing from Glencore, the FTSE 100 miner, and preparatory construction work at the 93-hectare site has begun.

Securing investment in UK-based battery manufacturing has been an important goal for the government. The prime minister, Boris Johnson, has on several occasions referred to his hopes for the project as part of his plans to “level up” parts of the country that have missed out on investment in recent decades.

The plant will be based in the constituency of Wansbeck, narrowly retained by Labour in the 2019 general election. It is next door to Blyth Valley, a seat formerly part of Labour’s “red wall”, which voted in a Conservative MP for the first time in that election.

Johnson said the plan “is a strong testament to the skilled workers of the north-east and the UK’s place at the helm of the global green industrial revolution”. He added that the factory will “boost the production of electric vehicles in the UK”.

Rolton said Britishvolt had taken part in a jobs fair in the area which prompted “queues round the block”, while some parents even took children out of school to attend. “That’s what it means for the area,” he said.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/21/britishvolt-electric-car-battery-uk-gigafactory-blyth-jobs
