14 September 2023 – Verkor secures more than €2 billion in financing following the signing of a minimum of €850m Series C funding1 , approval of European Investment Bank for €600m debt support and French subsidies for an amount around €650m, subject to final approval by the European Commission.

This financing will accelerate:

the construction of Verkor’s first gigafactory, in Dunkirk, and the manufacture of highperformance low-carbon battery cells,

ongoing technological developments at the Verkor Innovation Centre (VIC) for new manufacturing technologies and new state-of-the-art product,

strategic investments across the battery value chain, thereby generating thousands of direct and indirect long-term jobs.

This financial support and the presence of prominent funding partners demonstrate the business viability of Verkor’s robust development plan, backed by established contracts with tier-one partners, including a long-term commercial partnership with Renault Group. It will not only provide the European automotive industry with low-carbon batteries but will also play a key role to support the European sovereignty in sustainable electric mobility and energy storage.

The largest equity raise for a French start-up

Macquarie Asset Management, via its Energy Transition Solutions Fund, becomes lead investor in Verkor’s Series C funding round. With the recent addition of cornerstone investor Meridiam1 , they join forces to finance Verkor’s first gigafactory, in Dunkirk, new technological development programmes and investments across the low carbon battery value chain.

Macquarie Asset Management, the world’s largest infrastructure manager and a leading energy transition investor, will invest via its specialist Green Investment team. Meridiam, an independent investment Benefit Corporation and asset manager is taking a significant stake in the round1 and will also play an active role in supporting the development of Verkor’s first Gigafactory.

Also joining in the round are Verkor’s original key industrial and financial partners such as Renault Group, EQT Ventures, EIT InnoEnergy and Sibanye-Stillwater. The SPI investment fund (Société de projets industriels) which is operated by Bpifrance (the French public investment bank) is increasing its investment in this round, as part of the “Invest for the Future” programme.

This equity round also benefits from the French insurance ecosystem’s strong support for green reindustrialisation, thanks to significant investment from Crédit Agricole Assurances and the Fonds Stratégique de Participations (FSP), operated by ISALT. Crédit Agricole Assurances, France’s largest insurance group, is a leading institutional investor in renewable sources of energy with 11,8 GW of installed capacity in Europe at the end of 2022. The FSP aims to help the development and transition of French strategic industries by providing significant long-term investment. The Fund is supported by seven leading French insurance companies which will contribute to strengthen Verkor’s growth through their vast ecosystem.

PULSE, the CMA CGM Energy Fund, contributed to the fundraising as part of a broader partnership with Verkor around the supply chain and decarbonisation of the transport and logistics industries. Also participating is Netherlands-based Airbridge Investments, a strong supporter of building better and more environmentally conscious businesses.

The round size, which is subject to customary regulatory approvals, is a minimum of €850 million and could increase in the following weeks.

National and local authorities fully engaged

Verkor will also receive around €650m in subsidies primarily from the French State under the “France 2030” plan, including the support of the Hauts-de-France region and the Dunkirk urban community, which will issue €60m and €30m in subsidies respectively.

Their support will be subject to final approval by the European Commission within the Framework for State aid for Research and Development and Innovation. It enables an ambitious innovation programme performed by Verkor and its partners in cutting-edge manufacturing techniques using digital and recycling technologies. These technologies are being developed at the Verkor Innovation Centre in Grenoble and will be scaled up in Verkor’s gigafactory.

Strong support from European public players

This Series C funding comes just after the board of the European Investment Bank (EIB) approved a €600m support package through project finance debt and intermediated funding lines. This initial support is part of a broader project finance debt currently in progress with commercial banks alongside the EIB.

Verkor selects Dunkirk for its first Gigafactory,2022-02-01 17:15:00+00:00,"Press release, Uncategorized

French industrial company Verkor announces the selection of the port city of Dunkirk (Hauts de France) for the construction of its first Gigafactory for the development of low-carbon battery cells designed to support Europe’s net-zero goals.

First delivery of low-carbon high performance batteries for electric vehicles scheduled for July 2025 to be manufactured in Dunkirk

Manufacturing capacity to expand from 16 GWh in 2025 to 50 GWh by 2030.

The announcement marks a significant milestone for Verkor, founded in 2020, realising the company’s vision and accelerating its goals for battery development. Dunkirk is the most promising site out of the 40 investigated by Verkor in France, Spain and Italy. Spanning more than 150 hectares, the site will meet growing demand from European and international car manufacturers, as the roll-out of high-performance electric vehicles continues to gather pace across the continent.

The site meets all the requirements for a Gigafactory in terms of land, logistics, energy capacity, proximity to customers, access to a qualified workforce, and scalability. Up to 1,200 direct jobs and more than 3,000 indirect jobs are expected to be generated during the first phase of the project. The Verkor Gigafactory in Dunkirk will create a new ecosystem of players and solutions to support the development of Europe’s battery value chain. The high performance, low carbon batteries from Verkor’s site will contribute to the continued excellence and innovation of the French and European automotive industry.

Once operational, the Gigafactory will supply several customers, and most notably Renault Group after signing a strategic partnership with Verkor last summer.

Benoit Lemaignan, CEO of Verkor: “We are eager now to work with our partners to unite all the winning conditions to build the best battery-cell factory in the world. Dunkirk is the best choice among many other great opportunities, and I really want to thank all the people in the territories, as well as our partners including Groupe IDEC, who supported us in this process.”

Verkor and the French National Commission for Public Debate are now moving forward with the national consultation process for the site.

Agnès Pannier-Runacher, the French Minister of Industry: “Mastering the entire battery value chain is critical to the transition to electric mobility. I welcome this new important step by Verkor. Their choice of location reinforces “the electric battery valley” that is taking shape in the Hauts de France, as well as its dynamic ecosystem. It sends a positive signal to Dunkirk’s industrial platform, which has key assets in the sector. Verkor, like many players in the value chain, can rely on the Government’s ongoing support under the France 2030 plan.”

The construction of the Gigafactory is scheduled to begin in 2023. Research and development will continue to be based out of Grenoble where the construction of the Verkor Innovation Centre (VIC) is already under way. The innovations developed there will be a prelude to the manufacturing excellence of Verkor’s first Gigafactory.
