CATL Will Build Massive 100 GWh Battery Plant In Hungary,2022-08-12,"Contemporary Amperex Technology Co., Limited (CATL) officially announced today a massive new battery plant investment in Europe.

The Chinese manufacturer intends to invest €7.34 billion ($7.5 billion) to build a 100 GWh EV battery plant in Debrecen, Hungary. Once approved at the shareholder meeting, construction of the first production facilities will start before the end of this year.

That would be CATL's second battery plant in Europe, as the first one (much smaller) is expected to start production this year in Erfurt, Germany (8 GWh annually initially and 14 GWh annually in the future). This project was started in 2019.

According to CATL, the factory in Hungary will produce cells and modules (undisclosed chemistry) for European automakers. The location is in relatively close proximity to some plants of CATL's customers, including Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Stellantis and Volkswagen. Mercedes-Benz specifically said that it is the first and the biggest customer of the new plant’s initial capacity.

The company explains that the new 100 GWh plant will ""enable it to better cope with the battery demands of the European market, improve its global production network development, and help accelerate e-mobility and energy transition in Europe.""

The factory will be powered by renewable electricity sources. The Chinese investment (the largest ever in the region) is expected to create up to 9,000 jobs.

According to the press release, there is also a potential to ""establish facilities for battery materials in Europe"", which means that we might see more CATL investments.

Dr. Robin Zeng, founder and Chairman of CATL said:

“There is no doubt that our plant in Debrecen will enable us to further sharpen our competitive edge, better respond to our European customers, and accelerate the transition to e-mobility in Europe. The greenfield project in Hungary will be a giant leap in CATL’s global expansion, and also an important step in our efforts to make an outstanding contribution to the green energy drive for humankind.”

Péter Szijjártó, Hungarian Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade, said:

“Both the global and the European economies have been faced with tremendous challenges recently. We in Hungary have a clear goal to be a local exception from the continental recession. The best tool to achieve this goal is to attract state-of-the-art investments in the most revolutionary branch of the automotive industry, namely electromobility. We are proud that CATL decided to execute the biggest ever greenfield investment in the history of Hungary. We have recently become one of the leading battery production sites of the world and with this huge investment we further strengthen our position.”

CATL To Build $7.6 Billion 100 GWh Battery Factory In Hungary,2022-08-14 00:00:00,"Sign up for daily news updates from CleanTechnica on email. Or follow us on Google News

At the end of last year, CATL, the world’s largest battery manufacturer, had an annual production capacity of 170 GWh. It has plans to increase that to 670 GWh by 2025, according to Reuters. A major part of that expansion of capacity will come from a new $7.6 billion battery factory to be located on 221 hectares (546 acres) in the Southern Industrial Park in the city of Debrecen in Hungary. The project will supply both cells and modules to European automakers, including Mercedes, BMW, Volkswagen, and Stellantis according to a joint press release by the company and officials in Hungary.

As part of its commitment to reducing the carbon footprint of battery manufacturing, CATL will use electricity from renewable energies and will work with local partners to develop solar power and battery material suppliers both locally and throughout Europe.

“There is no doubt that our plant in Debrecen will enable us to further sharpen our competitive edge, better respond to our European customers, and accelerate the transition to e-mobility in Europe,” said Dr. Robin Zeng, founder and chairman of CATL. “The greenfield project in Hungary will be a giant leap in CATL’s global expansion, and also an important step in our efforts to make an outstanding contribution to the green energy drive for humankind.”

Hungary is becoming a major hub for electric vehicles and batteries in Europe. Debrecen is home to a plant being built by BMW, while Audi has a factory in Gyor in western Hungary’ and Mercedes-Benz has a factory in Kecskemet, in the central part of the country.

Péter Szijjártó, Hungarian Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade, added, “Both the global and the European economies have been faced with tremendous challenges recently. We in Hungary have a clear goal to be a local exception from the continental recession. The best tool to achieve this goal is to attract state of the art investments in the most revolutionary branch of the automotive industry, namely electromobility. We are proud that CATL decided to execute the biggest ever greenfield investment in the history of Hungary. We have recently become one of the leading battery production sites of the world and with this huge investment we further strengthen our position.”

Markus Schäfer, chief technical officer for Mercedes, said, “This new state of the art European CATL plant in Hungary is another milestone for the scale-up of our EV production together with our key partners. With CATL we have a technology leader as our partner to provide us — as the first and biggest customer of the new plant’s initial capacity — with top notch CO2 neutral battery cells for our next generation EVs in Europe, hence following our local to local approach in procurement. We’re proud to see our Ambition 2039 supported by CATL’s commitment to CO2 neutral production in Hungary.”

One question the press release does not answer is whether the battery cells produced at the new factory will use NMC or LFP chemistries. A good guess is that the correct answer is “both.” BMW may prefer NMC cells because they support higher performance levels while Volkswagen may choose LFP batteries for models that compete directly with Tesla, which is getting ready to begin offering a new version of the Model Y built in Germany that will use LFP Blade batteries from BYD.

What About CATL And North America?

This news raises the question, what plans does CATL have for new factories in North America? The US has just passed a new law known as the Inflation Reduction Act which makes it abundantly clear that batteries and battery components sourced from China will not be eligible for the EV tax credits included in that legislation. Europe seems much less concerned with such matters.

We reported recently that CATL was considering sites in Mexico and the US for a new North American factory, but the kerfuffle over Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan may have delayed any decision. Reuters reports that a source with knowledge of the situation says CATL had not changed its plan to start local battery production for North America from 2026. The expansion is expected to provide EV batteries for Ford, BMW, and potentially other automakers, including Tesla.

CATL plans to supply LFP battery cells to Ford for its second-generation F-150 Lightning electric pickup truck, but there are no reports (yet) of BMW using LFP cells. It seems likely CATL’s new factories will be capable of producing whatever battery cells its customers require to meet shifting market demands and supply chain variables.

CATL’s New Battery Plant To Become Hungary’s Largest Greenfield FDI Project Ever,,"Leading market player Contemporary Amperex Technology Co., Limited (CATL) will invest EUR 7.34 billion to build a 100 GWh battery plant in Debrecen, Hungary. The investment that is to create over 9,000 new jobs will become Hungary’s largest FDI project ever and is set to strengthen the role of the country as one of the world’s leading battery producers.

China-based CATL, a global leader in lithium-ion battery development and manufacturing picked Hungary as the location of its second European plant following the one in Germany. Construction is scheduled to commence this year on 221 hectares in the Southern Industrial Park of Debrecen.

Thanks to its sound business environment, the available well-developed infrastructure and logistics connections, a long-established automotive industry as well as abundant competitive workforce, Debrecen promises to be the perfect choice of location for the company for many reasons.

In addition, with its the proximity of plants of its customers such as Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Stellantis and Volkswagen, the Hungarian plant will enable CATL to better cope with the battery demands of the European market, improve its global production network development, and help accelerate e-mobility and energy transition in Europe.

As part of its commitment to reducing the carbon footprint in battery manufacturing, CATL will use electricity from renewable energies, and it is also examining the possibility of joining forces with local partners to establish facilities for battery materials in Europe to build a sustainable and circular battery value chain.

The Chinese company considers the investment as a giant leap in its global expansion that is expected to improve its competitive edge to a great extent.

The volume of the project also bears special significance as it will be the largest greenfield investment in Hungary, exceeding investment records of the previous years. HIPA played a crucial role in making it happen as the Agency has been providing professional support from the outset, and it will continue to provide a full range of consultancy services even after the deal was closed to assist in the implementation phase.",https://hipa.hu/news/catl-s-new-battery-plant-to-become-hungary-s-largest-greenfield-fdi-project-ever-/
CATL’s Record Volume Hungarian Project Formally Launched In Debrecen - VIDEO REPORT,,"The signing of a document that contains a commitment to purchase the relevant plot marked the formal launch of the EUR 7.34 billion investment of leading battery manufacturer Contemporary Amperex Technology Co., Limited (CATL) in Debrecen. The planned 100 GWh plant is not only the largest-ever greenfield project in Hungary but it also embodies the biggest battery-related investment of all time in the entire European Union.

The presale purchase agreement of a plot has been formally signed in Debrecen that will be home to the second European battery plant of China-based CATL, a global leader in lithium-ion battery development and manufacturing.

The battery plant is set to enrich an already vibrant local EV ecosystem predominated by Asian investors, given that HIPA closed 43 battery manufacturing-related deals worth EUR 7.9 bln between 2016 and the first half of 2022. Hungary’s position as an EV powerhouse is also set to strengthen: it now has the world’s third largest e-battery capacity, with the current 50 GWh to grow to 150 GWh by 2025.

We acknowledge and highly appreciate that Chinese companies bring state-of-the-art technology to Hungary. So far very important infrastructure developments have been going on under the Debrecen 2030 Strategy as a result of which the city became an economic powerhouse with cross-border and regional impact. This process is further boosted by those e-battery manufacturers and suppliers that decide to set up shop here. On the other hand, CATL’s project is also significant because after China and Germany we will be the third country where the company establishes a plant, and consequently, three out of the six largest e-battery manufacturers in the world will be present in our country

- Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade Péter Szijjártó said following the signing ceremony.

CATL aims to expand its footprint in Europe to meet market demand for its products and further sharpen its competitive edge.

We are committed to contributing to and integrating into the local community and the EV industry in Hungary. This battery plant we make will be another milestone in our journey towards a green future. I firmly believe our goals dovetail perfectly with Hungary’s pledge to achieve carbon neutrality,

Dr. Robin Zeng, Chairman of CATL said.

The magnitude of the EUR 7.34 bln project can be showcased by the fact that its volume nearly equals to the total investment volume of the seven largest FDI deals guided by HIPA since 2014. In the European Union it also ranks among the top 5 largest-ever FDI’s of the past decade, and on the EU level it is the ultimate record-breaking investment in the field of battery manufacturing.

Accordingly, China intensifies its investment activity in Hungary. In fact, its investment volume exceeded that of any other nations in the year of 2020 in Hungary, and overall it is the tenth biggest investor accounting for 3.2% of the total FDI stock.",https://hipa.hu/news/catl-s-record-volume-hungarian-project-formally-launched-in-debrecen/
