VARTA launches gigafactory for energy storage systems,2023-06-14 00:00:00,"With an investment of more than 20 million euros, the company wants to meet the continuing strong demand. Further investments are planned.

VARTA AG is investing in the growth market of renewable energies: In the summer, its new factory for energy storage systems will go into operation. In future, up to 100,000 energy storage systems per year will be produced on a total area of more than 5000 square metres at the Neunheim site in Ellwangen, Baden-Württemberg. With an average capacity of ten kilowatt hours per energy storage system, the production output will then correspond to more than one gigawatt hour per year.

Production is highly automated and uses the latest Industry 4.0 technologies, including robots and laser welding processes. The Ellwangen-based technology company is investing more than 20 million euros for this. Further investments are planned. A total of around 120 jobs will be created at the new plant.

Dominik Gluba, General Manager of VARTA Energy Storage: ""Growth in the home storage market continues unabated. In the first quarter of 2023, more than 110,000 new storage units were installed in Germany. For the first half of the year, we expect almost 240,000 new installations in Germany. With the production capacities of the new Gigafactory, we can adapt well to the growing market.""

The expansion of production will take place in two stages: Starting in the fourth quarter of 2023, the production output should be around 500 megawatt hours per year, which corresponds to about 50,000 storage systems. The output is then to be increased to one gigawatt hour by the beginning of 2025 at the latest.

The investment in the future market of renewable energies is part of VARTA AG's overall strategic concept. The company had announced that it would target growth markets even more specifically with innovative products as part of its restructuring.

The production facility in the immediate vicinity of the VARTA headquarters in Ellwangen underlines the loyalty of the tradition-rich company to production in Germany. With direct access to the A7 motorway, the new factory is well connected and accessible to the surrounding metropolises of Ulm, Würzburg and Stuttgart. A further expansion of the site is already under consideration: Additional production lines are to be added in the near future, and expansion areas have already been planned on site.",https://www.varta-ag.com/en/about-varta/news/details/varta-launches-gigafactory-for-energy-storage-systems

Varta to launch EV battery production,2021-03-16 00:00:00,"The battery manufacturer Varta aims to get involved in the market for electric car battery cells in the future. Up to now, the German company has primarily produced batteries for household electronics but has been involved in cell research for some time.

According to the German business publication Wirtschaftswoche, the new large-format battery cell 21700 is at the centre of Varta’s plans. The paper refers to “circles close to the company”, Varta itself did not want to comment on the topic. The company is currently building a pilot line for the 21700 cells at its headquarters in Ellwangen. According to the report, these are initially to be used primarily in high-performance electric cars – “for example as a short-term accelerator or as part of drive concepts in which the battery is permanently recharged by a motor while driving”, it says. Varta is currently in talks with several car manufacturers about this.

In the course of research activities, Varta is already known to many players in the electromobility industry – be it for the development of digitalised large-scale production of large-format battery cells alongside Fraunhofer IPA and ZSW or, more recently, for the creation of novel battery separators made of glass together with the University of Bayreuth and Tesla.

However, Varta moved into the limelight first and foremost with its participation in the first battery IPCEI (“Important Projects of Common European Interest”) of the European Union and with subsidies amounting to 300 million euros, which were granted to the company by the federal government and also by the states of Bavaria and Baden-Württemberg in 2022. According to the report, two-thirds of this sum will flow into the research and development of the new 21700 cells. The subsidies, which the European Commission approved under state aid law, can be drawn down by Varta until the end of 2024.

When the funding notifications were handed over in June last year, it was specifically stated that Varta would work on two projects: In addition to developing the latest generation of small-format lithium-ion cells with higher energy densities, the company plans to focus on transferring its technology to larger cell formats, for example for electric cars. However, the larger cells should also be able to be used in stationary battery storage or robots, for example.

In the course of setting up a pilot line for the new 21700 cells in Ellwangen, Varta is planning a recruitment drive: the group announced in mid-2020 that it intends to create around 1,000 new jobs in the German towns of Ellwangen and Nördlingen by the end of 2021. For Varta, this is enormous growth: the company currently has around 4,000 employees.

VARTA AG receives public funding of € 300 million for battery cell production facility (IPCEI)

Ellwangen, June 29, 2020. VARTA AG has today been informed by the Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs and Energy (BMWi) about public funding totaling € 300 million for two projects in connection with the European initiative to construct a battery cell production facility within the framework of an Important Project of Common European Interest (IPCEI).

The State government of Baden-Württemberg had previously already resolved at the end of March this year to co-finance the grant to be awarded by the BMWi for the first project. In mid-May, the Bavarian government then committed to co-financing the second project within the framework of this European initiative. Both projects have now received formal approval from the Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs and Energy as a direct sponsor of VARTA AG.

The first project for the development and industrialization of coin shaped lithium-ion cells has received funding in the amount of approximately € 198.5 million and will run until the end of 2024. The second project for the development and industrialization of small lithium-ion cells in addition to special format lithium-ion battery cells, the duration of which will run until the end of June 2022, is to be supported to the tune of up to €° 101.5 million.

The total public funding received in the form of grants by VARTA for the two IPCEI projects therefore amounts to € 300 million. VARTA will initially finance the supported project. The approved public funding will then be used to reimburse VARTA for the depreciation from the investments and the operating expenses incurred in connection with the two supported projects over the respective project duration proportionately up to the aforementioned funding volume.

Germany invests in battery research with Varta,2020-06-30 00:00:00,"Varta has now received funding positive decisions from the Germany federal government and the states of Bavaria and Baden-Württemberg concerning 300 million euros for projects involving battery cells. The subsidy was approved by the EU Commission in December 2019 and the decisions have now been sent to Varta.

Varta is part of the first IPCEI (Important Projects of Common European Interest) for the promotion of research and innovation in the field of battery cells, which was approved by the European Commission under state aid law. Varta can call on the funds until the end of 2024.

Varta will use the funds to work on two projects. In addition to the development of the latest generation of small-format lithium-ion cells with higher energy densities, the company will focus on transferring its technology to larger cell formats, for example for electric cars. The larger cells should also be suitable for use in stationary battery storage systems or robots.

The new battery formats will be optimised on a pilot line and transferred to mass production. The Varta Group wants to create about 1,000 new jobs in Ellwangen in Baden Wurttemberg and the Bavarian district of Nördlingen by the end of next year. For Varta, this is an enormous growth: the company currently has about 4,000 employees.

The European heads of government have been trying to establish a battery cell production in Germany for years in order to reduce the dependence on Asian companies. In the case of Varta, the hope is that the world market leader for small batteries in hearing aids or wireless headphones will also be able to build high-performance batteries for much larger devices in the future. At the first IPCEI in Germany, in addition to subsidies for Varta, subsidies were approved for BMW, BASF and Umicore – and for Opel, which wants to set up cell production in Kaiserslautern, Germany, as part of the battery consortium with Saft.

“With the IPCEI, we will further expand VARTA’s lithium-ion technology, accelerate the development of the latest generations, and bring new products to market,” says Varta CEO Herbert Schein. Federal Minister of Economics Peter Altmaier added: “The establishment of innovative and sustainable battery cell production in Germany is a high priority for us. It is necessary to remain competitive, create new jobs and secure prosperity in line with the transformation of energy and transport”.
