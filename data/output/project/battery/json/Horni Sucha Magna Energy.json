        "notes": "Location:\nThe battery production plant is located in Horn\u00ed Such\u00e1 near Hav\u00ed\u0159ov in the north of the Czech Republic.\n\nCapacity:\nThe planned capacity of the Magna Energy Storage (MES) manufacturing plant for the HE3DA batteries is not explicitly mentioned in the provided information.\n\nInvestment amounts:\nThe specific capital invested in the project or announced planned investment is not provided in the given text. However, it is mentioned that the project has attracted many investors and is being financed by Radom\u00edr Prus.\n\nProject progress:\nThe Magna Energy Storage (MES) manufacturing plant for the HE3DA batteries is set to be officially opened on Thursday, September 17, 2020. The production technologies are being finalized, and the batteries are undergoing a series of tests. The plant is described as one of the first to be completely robotized and automated, meeting the requirements for Industry 4.0 qualification.\n\nProject type:\nThe project is a new build, as it is a wholly Czech-conceived and realized factory in the Moravian-Silesian region of the Czech Republic.\n\nValue chain stages:\nThe text mentions that the HE3DA battery production will serve as energy storage banks in two initial areas of demand: modular units for on-demand energy storage installations and efficient powerpacks for the electric vehicle industry. However, specific details about the stages covered at the facility, such as cathode and anode manufacturing, cell fabrication, and module assembly, are not provided."
