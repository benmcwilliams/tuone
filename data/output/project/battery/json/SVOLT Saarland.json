        "date": "2022-09-10 00:00:00",
        "notes": "Location:\n- SVOLT is building a new cell factory for the European battery industry in Lauchhammer, Brandenburg, Germany. They have also confirmed factories in the German state of Saarland, near the town of \u00dcberherrn, and close to a battery assembly in Heusweiler, also in Saarland.\n\nCapacity:\n- The initial capacity of the Lauchhammer site is planned to be 16 GWh, with the potential for expansion in the future.\n\nInvestment amounts:\n- The investment amounts and subsidies for the project are not specified in the provided information.\n\nProject progress:\n- SVOLT is planning to start production in Brandenburg in early 2025. The company aims to repurpose the former wind turbine plant in Lauchhammer, with rebuilding and extension works expected to be necessary. The construction of the Saarland sites is facing delays, with production in \u00dcberherrn now expected to start in 2027, four years later than initially announced.\n\nProject type:\n- The Lauchhammer project is a repurposing of a former wind turbine plant, making it a brownfield project. The Saarland sites involve construction on existing buildings.\n\nValue chain stages:\n- The facility in Lauchhammer is planned to cover cell manufacturing, with the potential for future expansion to cover other stages of the battery manufacturing process.\n\nNote: The information on investment amounts and subsidies is not provided in the given text."

        "notes": "Location:\n- The battery production project is located in Saarland, Germany, specifically in Heusweiler and \u00dcberherrn.\n\nCapacity:\n- The planned capacity for the cell factory in \u00dcberherrn was initially announced to be 24 GWh, with operations scheduled to start in mid-2022. However, due to delays, cell production in \u00dcberherrn is not expected before 2027.\n\nInvestment amounts:\n- The specific capital invested in the project or announced as planned investment is not provided in the given information.\n\nProject progress:\n- The assembly of battery cells into modules and packs at the Heusweiler site is scheduled to begin in April 2023, with the final completion contractually agreed by mid-2024. The cell factory in \u00dcberherrn is significantly delayed, with cell production not expected before 2027.\n\nProject type:\n- The project involves the establishment of a new build for the assembly of modules and packs in Heusweiler and the construction of a cell factory in \u00dcberherrn.\n\nValue chain stages:\n- The facility in Heusweiler is focused on the assembly of battery cells into modules and packs. However, the information does not specify whether cathode and anode manufacturing or cell fabrication are part of the project.\n\nNote: The information does not provide specific details on the investment amounts or subsidies received for the project."
