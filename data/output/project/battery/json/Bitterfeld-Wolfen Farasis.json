        "notes": "Location:\n- The battery cell plant for Mercedes-Benz is being built in Bitterfeld-Wolfen, Germany. Farasis Energy (Ganzhou) Co., Ltd., the Chinese battery cell manufacturer, has a production plant in Zhenjiang, China, and is planning a production site in Bitterfeld-Wolfen, Germany, which will be CO2-neutral from the start. An additional plant in the U.S. is also planned.\n\nCapacity:\n- The planned capacity of the battery cell plant in Bitterfeld-Wolfen, Germany, is not explicitly mentioned in the provided information.\n\nInvestment amounts:\n- Daimler Greater China is investing a multi-million euro amount as part of Farasis' IPO, and is taking a stake of around three percent in Farasis Energy (Ganzhou) Co., Ltd. The equity stake is conditional upon required regulatory approvals.\n\nProject progress:\n- Farasis is building a plant for battery cells in Bitterfeld-Wolfen, Germany, creating up to 2,000 new jobs. The site is designed as a CO2-neutral factory from the start. The investment in the battery cell manufacturer is actively driving forward the development of a key technology for electric mobility and its industrialization.\n\nProject type:\n- The project involves the construction of a new battery cell plant in Bitterfeld-Wolfen, Germany.\n\nValue chain stages:\n- The information provided does not explicitly specify the value chain stages covered at the facility."
