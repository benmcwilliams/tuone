The goal is to reach 6GW of production by 2024, and when the maximum capacity of 10GW is reached, a total investment of 400 million euros and around 500 direct employees are anticipated. There is also an option to expand to 20 GWh/year by 2027.\n\nInvestment amounts:\n- The planned investment for the battery cell factory is 400 million euros, with an additional 200 million euros for the construction of a cathode factory. The total estimated investment for the comprehensive energy storage project, including lithium and nickel extraction, is over 1,000 million euros. The project has received financing and has secured clients.\n\nProject progress:\n- The project presentation took place in M\u00e9rida, and the next step is to deliver the project plans to the Badajoz City Council to process its urban planning license. It is estimated that machines could start working on the plot by the end of this year or early 2022, with the inauguration of the initial 2GW module expected around the middle of 2023.\n\nProject type:\n- The battery cell factory is a new build project.\n\nValue chain stages:\n- The facility will cover the stages of cathode and anode manufacturing, cell fabrication, and module assembly.\n\nAdditional notes:\n- The project is part of a comprehensive energy storage project that includes the extraction of lithium and nickel, as well as the construction of a cathode factory. The project also involves the establishment of the National Energy Storage Center in C\u00e1ceres and the implementation of an engineering postgraduate master\u2019s degree at the University of Extremadura."
