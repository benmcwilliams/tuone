        "notes": "Location:\n- The project is located in Hungary, with the second plant in Kom\u00e1rom and the third plant in Iv\u00e1ncsa, 50 kilometers southwest of Budapest.\n\nCapacity:\n- The second battery cell plant in Kom\u00e1rom is planned to have an annual capacity of 10 GWh. The company aims to expand its production capacities to a total of over 500 GWh by 2030.\n\nInvestment amounts:\n- SK Innovation is investing about 945 billion won (approximately 700 million euros) in the construction of its second plant in Kom\u00e1rom. The Hungarian government has granted a subsidy of 90 million euros for the second plant.\n\nProject progress:\n- The construction of the second plant in Kom\u00e1rom is planned to be completed this year, with commercial production expected to begin in 2022. SK Innovation also decided to build a third battery cell factory in Hungary, specifically in Iv\u00e1ncsa.\n\nProject type:\n- The project involves the construction of a new battery cell plant in Kom\u00e1rom and the planned construction of a third battery cell factory in Iv\u00e1ncsa.\n\nValue chain stages:\n- The facility covers cell fabrication, as SK Innovation currently develops and produces pouch cells and is also looking into the development and production of new types of battery cells, including cylindrical and prismatic cells."
