        "notes": "Location:\n- The battery cell manufacturing project is located in Debrecen, Hungary.\n\nCapacity:\n- The factory will have an annual capacity of 28 gigawatt-hours and is expected to go into operation in 2026.\n\nInvestment amounts:\n- Eve Energy will invest around 400 billion forints (just over 1 billion euros) in the factory and create over 1,000 new jobs. The Hungarian government is supporting the construction with 14 billion forints, equivalent to about 38 million euros.\n\nProject progress:\n- Eve Energy had signed a non-binding letter of intent with the Debrecen Municipality to acquire 45 hectares in an industrial area and build a cylindrical cell production plant there. The factory is expected to be built on 45 hectares in the Northwest Economic Belt, reserved for BMW suppliers.\n\nProject type:\n- The project is a new build, with the factory being constructed from scratch.\n\nValue chain stages:\n- The facility will cover cell fabrication, where cathode and anode are combined with an electrolyte.\n\nNote: The information does not specify the current operational capacity or the specific stages of the value chain covered at the facility."
