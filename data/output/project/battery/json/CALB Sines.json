        "notes": "Location:\n- The battery factory project is planned to be located in Sines, Portugal, within the Sines Industrial and Logistics Zone.\n\nCapacity:\n- The planned capacity of the factory is 15GWh, with production scheduled to begin in 2025. It is expected to reach full capacity at cruising speed between 2028 and 2030, representing around 4% of Portuguese GDP.\n\nInvestment amounts:\n- The project has entered the environmental licensing process and a contract was signed to reserve surface rights over 92 hectares in the Sines Industrial and Logistics Zone. However, there is no specific information available about the capital invested or any subsidies received for the project.\n\nProject progress:\n- A memorandum of understanding for construction of the plant was signed in November. However, there have been no significant developments in the partnerships that CALB appears to have formalized with Portugal. The project remains \"active\" according to AICEP, but there are uncertainties about its progress due to issues faced by the CALB group in China and the lack of response from the group.\n\nProject type:\n- The project is a new build, described as a \"world-leading, highly intelligent, computerized and automated factory, with zero carbon emissions.\"\n\nValue chain stages:\n- The project is expected to cover the stages of cell fabrication, with the factory being a lithium battery production facility.\n\nNote: The project's progress and future are uncertain due to issues faced by the CALB group in China and potential implications of the decision to remove Huawei from national 5G networks."
