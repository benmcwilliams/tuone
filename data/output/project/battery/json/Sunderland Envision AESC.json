        "date": "2022-12-12 00:00:00",
        "notes": "Location:\n- The battery factory project is located near the Nissan plant in Sunderland, UK.\n\nCapacity:\n- The plant is expected to have an annual capacity of 12 GWh when it comes online in 2025, with an initial capacity of 11 GWh by 2024. The forecasted expansion is up to 25 GWh by 2030 and ultimately up to 35 GWh.\n\nInvestment amounts:\n- Envision AESC pledged to invest \u00a3450 million in the UK\u2019s \"first Gigafactory\" and plans to increase the initial investment to \u00a31.8 billion in a later phase. Nissan also promised up to \u00a3423 million to produce another electric model in Sunderland.\n\nProject progress:\n- The building works for the battery factory have begun, and the plant is expected to come online in 2025. The project is part of Nissan's EV36Zero initiative, which aims to bring together electric vehicle production, battery manufacturing, and renewables as part of the drive towards carbon neutrality.\n\nProject type:\n- The project is a new build, as Envision AESC is constructing the battery factory near the existing Nissan plant in Sunderland.\n\nValue chain stages:\n- It remains unclear whether the facility will manufacture cells or also house the assembly of entire battery modules. The article does not provide specific details on the value chain stages covered at the facility."

        "notes": "Location:\n- The battery plant project is located at the International Advanced Manufacturing Park (IAMP) in Washington, spanning land in South Tyneside and Sunderland, in the UK.\n\nCapacity:\n- The project is planned to have a capacity of 35GWh by 2030, with the aim of supporting battery production in 2024.\n\nInvestment amounts:\n- Envision AESC has secured an investment of \u00a3450 million for the project, with potential future investment of \u00a31.8 billion on the site by 2030. The project is part of a \u00a31 billion partnership with Nissan UK and Sunderland City Council.\n\nProject progress:\n- Construction of the new building is scheduled to begin in 2022 to support battery production in 2024. The plans for the gigafactory were unanimously approved at a meeting of the city council\u2019s Planning and Highways (West) Committee on October 5.\n\nProject type:\n- The project involves the construction of a new gigafactory at the IAMP site.\n\nValue chain stages:\n- The facility will cover the stages of cathode and anode manufacturing, cell fabrication, and module assembly.\n\nNote: The project is expected to create 750 green jobs and safeguard 300 jobs from its existing Sunderland plant, with potential future job creation of 4,500 new high-value green jobs by 2030."
