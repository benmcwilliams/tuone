        "notes": "Location:\n- The project is located in Poland, but the exact location has not been disclosed by Impact Clean Power Technology (ICPT).\n\nCapacity:\n- The GigafactoryX will initially produce 2 GWh of batteries per year starting from 2024, and it aims to reach a capacity of 5 GWh in the final stage.\n\nInvestment amounts:\n- The specific capital invested in the project has not been mentioned. However, ICPT has contracted Teamtechnik to build an automated assembly line for the production of batteries for buses, trams, and trains at its production facility in Poland.\n\nProject progress:\n- The construction of the GigafactoryX has begun, and ICPT has contracted Teamtechnik to build an automated assembly line for battery production. Assembly work is scheduled to begin in July 2023.\n\nProject type:\n- The project is a new build, as ICPT is constructing the GigafactoryX from scratch.\n\nValue chain stages:\n- The facility will cover several stages of the battery manufacturing value chain, including cathode and anode manufacturing, cell fabrication, and module assembly. Additionally, the production lines will be highly automated and powered by a photovoltaic system.\n\nNote: The project aims to use renewable energy, second-life battery systems, and recycled raw materials for production, and it plans to base production on short supply chains from European companies."
