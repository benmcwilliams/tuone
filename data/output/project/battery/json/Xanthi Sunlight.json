        "notes": "Location\nThe project is located in Xanthi, a cohesion (less developed) region in the North-Eastern part of Greece.\n\nCapacity\nThe nominal manufacturing capacity of the pilot line is up to 200 MWh. However, it's important to note that this pilot plant will not produce any commercial-grade cells.\n\nInvestment amounts\nThe proposed EIB finance for the project is approximately EUR 25 million, while the total cost is estimated to be around EUR 70 million. The project is part of a broader research, development, and innovation (RDI) project aimed at developing and producing complete Li-Ion battery systems, including the cells.\n\nProject progress\nAs of the latest update, the project has been signed on 31/10/2023. The investment covers the period 2022-2025, and the pilot line and R&D facilities are part of a broader RDI project.\n\nProject type\nThe project concerns the development of a pilot line to produce prototype Li-Ion cells in a greenfield building adjacent to the current Xanthi manufacturing plant. It is a new build project aimed at developing and producing complete Li-Ion battery systems.\n\nValue chain stages\nThe project covers the development of prototype Li-Ion cells, indicating involvement in the cell fabrication stage. However, it's important to note that the pilot plant will not produce any commercial-grade cells."
