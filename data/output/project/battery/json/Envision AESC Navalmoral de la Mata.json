        "notes": "Location:\n- Envision AESC is planning a new battery gigafactory in South Carolina, US, close to BMW Group's vehicle production and battery assembly facilities. They also have a facility in Smyrna, Tennessee, US, and are expanding globally with new plants in Japan, the UK, France, Spain, and China.\n\nCapacity:\n- The new battery gigafactory in South Carolina is planned to have a capacity of 30 GWh per year. The facility in Kentucky is also expected to have an output of 30 GWh per year, with an option for 40 GWh/year. The existing facility in Smyrna, Tennessee, US, has a capacity of approximately 3.0 GWh per year.\n\nInvestment amounts:\n- Specific investment amounts are not provided in the articles. However, Envision AESC is rapidly expanding its manufacturing capabilities globally, indicating significant investments in these projects. \n\nProject progress:\n- Envision AESC is currently working to finalize a suitable site for the new battery gigafactory in South Carolina. Further details are expected to be announced once the company secures the plot. The facility in Kentucky was announced in April 2022, and the company is also expanding its manufacturing capabilities in Japan, the UK, France, Spain, and China.\n\nProject type:\n- The projects include the construction of new battery gigafactories in various locations, indicating new builds.\n\nValue chain stages:\n- The articles do not provide specific information about the value chain stages covered at the facilities. However, Envision AESC's global expansion suggests involvement in multiple stages of the battery manufacturing process, including cathode and anode manufacturing, cell fabrication, and module assembly."
