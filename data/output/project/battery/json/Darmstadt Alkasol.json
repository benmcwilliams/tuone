        "notes": "Location:\n- The battery production project, named 'Gigafactory 1', is located at the headquarters of Akasol in Darmstadt, Germany.\n\nCapacity:\n- The production lines currently offer a production capacity of one gigawatt-hour (GWh).\n- Expansion to adjacent areas is planned with a potential capacity of up to 5 GWh per year, which would be enough for 10,000 electric buses and trucks.\n\nInvestment amounts:\n- Akasol has invested 100 million euros at the site for the production facility.\n\nProject progress:\n- Akasol had moved into the new headquarters in October 2020 and started production with an initial one GWh. The ceremonial opening of the plant did not take place last autumn due to pandemic-related restrictions.\n- With the addition of new production lines, a capacity of 2.5 GWh is expected to be reached in 2022, with up to five gigawatt-hours possible depending on customer demand.\n\nProject type:\n- The project is a new build, as it involves the construction of a highly automated and advanced production facility for lithium-ion battery modules and systems.\n\nValue chain stages:\n- The facility covers the stages of cell fabrication, module assembly, and equipping with controllers and cooling systems. The cells come from Samsung SDI and are assembled into modules and packs on-site.\n\nThis summarizes the key information from the articles related to the battery production project in Europe."
