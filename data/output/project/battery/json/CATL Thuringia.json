        "notes": "Location:\n- The battery production project is located in Thuringia, a state in the eastern part of Germany.\n\nCapacity:\n- The initial capacity of the new cell plant is 8 GWh per year, with plans to increase it to 14 GWh over time.\n\nInvestment amounts:\n- The total investment for the project is \u20ac1.8 billion ($2 billion).\n\nProject progress:\n- The construction of the plant is in the final stage, with the installation of machines in full swing. The company expects the first cells to roll off the assembly lines by the end of 2022, and the plant will employ around 1,500 people at that time. The goal is to achieve a production capacity of 14 GWh and create 2,000 jobs in Germany.\n\nProject type:\n- The project involves the construction of a new battery cell production facility.\n\nValue chain stages:\n- The facility covers cell production, assembly of cells into modules, and also features clean rooms, technical cleanliness, and constant humidity.\n\nAdditional information:\n- The site consists of two buildings: G1, an existing building purchased from another company where cells are assembled into modules, and G2, a newly-built plant where cells will be produced. The factory also generates part of its power from solar panels on the rooftop of the building."
