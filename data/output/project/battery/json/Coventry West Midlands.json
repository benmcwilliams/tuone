However, it is expected to begin supplying high-tech batteries for electric vehicles from 2025.\n\nInvestment amounts:\n- The project involves a \u00a32.5bn investment, creating up to 6,000 new highly skilled jobs directly and thousands more in the wider supply chain in Coventry and the surrounding region.\n\nProject progress:\n- The project has submitted an outline planning proposal in July, and the application is yet to be determined. It is expected to begin supplying batteries for electric vehicles from 2025.\n\nProject type:\n- N/A\n\nValue chain stages:\n- The project aims to cover the entire value chain, including recycling used batteries and building new ones in an industry-leading approach known as \"cradle to cradle.\"\n\nNote: The project is a joint venture between Coventry City Council and Coventry Airport Ltd, supported by an alliance of local governments, industrial groups, and universities. It is strategically crucial for the UK\u2019s electrified future, especially for the automotive industry which will stop producing petrol and diesel engines from 2030."
