        "notes": "Location:\n- The battery cell factory project is located in Kaiserslautern, Germany, as part of the EU\u2019s Battery IPCEI.\n\nCapacity:\n- The project aims to achieve a total production capacity of 24 GWh per year, with an initial phase leading to 8 GWh output scheduled to start in 2023. Battery production in Kaiserslautern is expected to begin in 2025.\n\nInvestment amounts:\n- The federal and state governments are funding the project with a total of 436.8 million euros. The companies involved in the joint venture are investing over two billion euros for this purpose.\n\nProject progress:\n- ACC, the Franco-German consortium, fired the starting gun to kick-off pilot production in January 2020 at a Saft facility in France. The first phase of construction is set to start in 2023, with battery production in Kaiserslautern expected to begin in 2025.\n\nProject type:\n- The project involves the construction of a new battery cell factory in Kaiserslautern, Germany.\n\nValue chain stages:\n- The project covers cell technology development and battery production, aiming to produce battery cells for around 500,000 electric vehicles annually.\n\nNote: The information provided is based on the articles related to the project."

        "notes": "Location:\n- The project involves the construction of automotive gigafactories in Douvrin, France (Hauts-de-France region) and Kaiserslautern, Germany.\n\nCapacity:\n- The cumulative capacity of both sites is planned to reach 48GWh by 2030, with production set to start in 2023.\n\nInvestment amounts:\n- The project represents an investment of more than \u20ac5 billion, including financial support of \u20ac1.3 billion from the French and German public authorities.\n\nProject progress:\n- The project was announced in January 2020 and confirmed in September 2020. The R&D and development have already started at the R&D site in Bordeaux and the pilot site in Nersac. Mass production is due to start in 2023.\n\nProject type:\n- The project involves the construction of new gigafactories for battery production.\n\nValue chain stages:\n- The project covers R&D, mass production, and aims to equip 1 million electric vehicles per year, representing more than 10% of the European market.\n\nNote: The project aims to support energy transition in the automotive industry and ensure Europe\u2019s industrial independence in battery production."
