There are plans to ramp up the battery capacity output to approximately 65 GWh, making the Polish facility one of the largest lithium-ion cell factories in the world.\n\nInvestment amounts:\n- The European Investment Bank (EIB) has signed a \u20ac480 million loan agreement with LG Chem Wroclaw Energy, covering around a third of the total project costs estimated at \u20ac1.5 billion. The remainder will come from the company\u2019s own resources and from other financing sources.\n\nProject progress:\n- The project has received a significant loan from the EIB, and the company plans to create a competitive battery value chain in Europe and Poland. The implementation of the new investment program will enable the company to ramp up its battery capacity output and create more than 1,800 jobs at the Wroclaw site by the end of 2022.\n\nProject type:\n- The project involves the construction and operation of highly automated and innovative manufacturing facilities for advanced lithium-ion cells and batteries for battery-powered electric vehicles. It includes the development of a fully integrated production system that will make all battery components from electrodes to cells, modules, and packs for the first time in Europe.\n\nValue chain stages:\n- The project covers the manufacturing of advanced lithium-ion cells and batteries for battery-powered electric vehicles, including the production of electrodes, cells, modules, and battery packs."
