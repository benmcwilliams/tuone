Northvolt and Volvo Cars select Gothenburg for gigafactory,2022-02-04 05:26:23+00:00,"Volvo Cars and Northvolt have selected Gothenburg, Sweden, to establish a new battery manufacturing plant which will commence operations in 2025, create up to 3,000 jobs and complement the planned R&D centre that both companies announced in December as part of an investment of approximately SEK 30 billion.

The new plant and close ties with Northvolt will significantly strengthen Volvo Carsâ electrification strategy as the company aims to produce and sell only fully electric cars by 2030.

Construction of the plant will start in 2023 and it will produce state-of-the-art battery cells, specifically developed for use in next-generation pure electric Volvo and Polestar cars.

The plant will have a potential annual cell production capacity of up to 50 gigawatt hours (GWh), which would supply batteries for approximately half a million cars per year.

The Swedish location of the plant, which will be built in Torslanda, Gothenburg offers benefits in terms of a direct route into Volvo Carsâ largest car plant, access to infrastructure, a strong pipeline of renewable energy supply and relevant job competences, as well as its proximity to both Volvo Carsâ and Northvoltâs R&D units.

âOur battery cell partnership with Northvolt is key to our strategic ambitions in electrification,â said HÃ¥kan Samuelsson, Volvo Cars chief executive. âWe are committed to becoming a leader in the premium electric car segment and selling only pure electric vehicles by 2030.â

âEstablishing this gigafactory in Gothenburg is a decisive move, both to continue to transform one of the most dynamic automotive regions in the world, and to become the leading global supplier of sustainable batteriesâ, said Peter Carlsson, Co-Founder and CEO of Northvolt.

As sustainable production is a central tenet of the partnership between Volvo Cars and Northvolt, the plant will be powered by fossil-free energy with focus on driving renewable energy capacity in the region, and will integrate engineering solutions which prioritize circularity and resource efficiency.

Battery production for Volvo Carsâ and Polestarâs fully electric models represents a large part of each carâs total life cycle carbon emissions. By working with Northvolt, a leader in sustainable battery production, and producing batteries near its manufacturing facilities in Europe, Volvo Cars and Polestar can significantly reduce the environmental footprint attributable to battery sourcing and production for their future cars.

âOur new battery plant will support our ambition to have a fully climate neutral manufacturing network and secure a supply of high-quality batteries for years to come,â said Javier Varela, head of engineering and operations at Volvo Cars. âThrough our partnership with Northvolt we will also benefit greatly from an end-to-end battery value chain, from raw material to complete car, ensuring optimal integration in our cars.â

The battery cell production joint venture between Northvolt and Volvo Cars will be a significant player in European battery cell production and will represent one of the largest cell production units in Europe. Volvo Cars and Northvolt have appointed former Tesla executive Adrian Clarke to lead the production company.

The R&D centre, which will become operational in 2022, will create a few hundred jobs in Gothenburg and positions Volvo Cars as one of the few automotive brands to make battery cell development and production part of its end-to-end engineering capabilities.

The partnership between Volvo Cars and Northvolt will focus on developing tailor-made batteries and vehicle integration concepts that give Volvo and Polestar drivers what they want, such as long range and quick charging times. Establishing deep vertical integration of battery development and production is important for Volvo Cars and Polestar, since the battery represents the largest individual cost component in an electric car, as well as a major part of the carbon footprint.

Taken together, the new battery plant and R&D centre will need a range of competences and the joint venture company is therefore actively recruiting highly skilled engineers and team leaders to advance the project. Large scale recruitment of operators and technicians will begin late 2023.

Why Gothenburg gets battery gigafactory,2022-02-15,"15 February 2022

Gothenburg won the tug-of-war for Volvo Cars and Northvolt’s new battery manufacturing plant. The establishment has been described as an industrial gold bar – and that gold bar is coming to Torslanda. The deciding factors were the city’s collaborative capacity, superior logistics, skills clusters, and access to sustainable cooling and fossil free electricity.

During a joint press conference, Volvo Cars and Northvolt announced that Gothenburg had emerged victorious from the months-long municipal contest. Torslanda will be the site of the companies’ new battery plant, next door to Volvo Cars’ final assembly plant.

“Establishing this gigafactory in Gothenburg is a decisive move, both to continue to transform one of the most dynamic automotive regions in the world, and to become the leading global supplier of sustainable batteries”, said Peter Carlsson, CEO of Northvolt, in a press release.

The establishment will create 3,000 new jobs in Gothenburg – along with many more in the region through the ecosystem that will be built around the large factory. Javier Varela, Head of Engineering and Operations at Volvo Cars, explained during the joint press conference why Gothenburg was selected:

“We have looked at a multitude of sites, both inside and outside Sweden. We ultimately chose Gothenburg because of the infrastructure, the logistics, the proximity to the Volvo Cars factory where we get the materials, access to fossil-free energy, and access to skills.”

The City of Gothenburg, with Business Region Göteborg as coordinator, has in record time developed solutions that fully meet Volvo Cars and Northvolt’s requirements.

“We have received enormous support from the municipality and the region,” Carlsson said during the press conference.

Superior infrastructure and logistics

The logistics opportunities in Gothenburg were assessed as superior. For instance, the Port of Gothenburg is just a ten-minute drive from where the battery plant will be built. It is Scandinavia's largest port, and it is frequently described as a core of Sweden’s infrastructure.

“No other port in Sweden can offer what we can here,” said Claes Sundmark, Vice President, Sales and Marketing at the Port of Gothenburg. “Through our route network, we reach all the important European markets, and every week we have departures to Asia. In addition, we have the capacity to expand substantially and sustainably. Huge volumes already move between Torslanda and the Port of Gothenburg, but we will have no difficulties increasing this.”

Gothenburg – a skills cluster

Another strong argument for establishing the battery plant in Gothenburg is access to skills and the city’s ability to attract new talent. Metropolitan Gothenburg is home to a skills cluster with international roots, which can supply the battery plant with engineers.



“It’s a strength for Gothenburg that Chalmers is here, a fully equipped technical university with the necessary conditions for providing education in battery technology,” said Mikael Enelund, Head of the Mechanical Engineering Programme at Chalmers. “We also have the ability to quickly change our existing courses to meet new needs.”

Around 30 per cent of the students in Chalmers Master’s programme are international. Many of them are attracted by the job opportunities in Gothenburg’s well-known automotive sector and stay after completing their degrees.

However, according to Enelund, the number of newly qualified engineers is not sufficient to cover the need for labour:

“Going forward, and in cooperation with other higher education institutions and industry operators, we will also create formats to further train professional engineers who, for example, currently work with internal combustion engines and will therefore need to switch over.”

Existing expertise on battery development and innovation

The Gothenburg region already serves as an engine for innovation in battery technology and electromobility, and the region is seen as an international role model when it comes to fossil fuel-free transport systems. Progressive collaboration projects constitute an important piece of the puzzle.

One example is the testbed called Swedish Electric Transport Laboratory (Seel), which is owned by Chalmers and RISE. Claes Winzell, Research and Business Developer at RISE, is leading a project to establish a Seel facility in Borås, where, from 2023, industry, institutes, and academia will be able to conduct safety tests on batteries. Another, even larger testing facility for electromobility is being built in Säve outside Gothenburg and will be completed in 2023.

“The Volvo Group and Volvo Cars are two operators who have promised to establish testing at these facilities,” said Winzell. “Seel will thus be able to play an important role in Volvo Cars and Northvolt’s joint battery production.

“It’s easy to talk about the different facilities in our region, but what it actually involves is ‘brain power’. In western Sweden, we have researchers in an array of technical areas that are useful for the development of batteries and their use in products,” said Winzell.

Discussions ongoing regarding electricity supply

Northvolt and Volvo Cars also highlight access to fossil fuel-free electricity as an argument for establishing the battery plant in Gothenburg. According to the parties, there is a plan to secure access, but discussions are still ongoing. Among other things, there are talks about offshore wind farms on the west coast.

It is clear that the establishment of a factory of this size will generate opportunities as well as present challenges for Gothenburg. Extensive work will need to be carried out to get all the pieces in place, and a success factor moving forward will be something that has permeated the process thus far: cooperation.

The companies behind the battery manufacturing plant have assessed that the infrastructure, the skills cluster, and now ‘battery city’ Gothenburg have what it takes to refine the gold bar that has been given to Torslanda.
