Eve Energy to build battery factory in Hungary,2023-05-10 00:00:00,"The Chinese battery cell manufacturer Eve Energy will build its first European factory in Debrecen, Hungary, to supply BMW with large round cells for new-class electric cars. This had been hinted at before – and is now officially confirmed.

According to Hungarian media reports based on official statements by Hungary’s Foreign Minister Péter Szijjártó and on an announcement by Eve Energy, the factory in Debrecen will have an annual capacity of 28 gigawatt-hours and go into operation in 2026. According to Szijjártó, Eve Energy will invest around 400 billion forints (just over 1 billion euros) in the factory and create over 1,000 new jobs. The Hungarian government is supporting the construction with 14 billion forints, the equivalent of about 38 million euros.

The cell plant is to be built on 45 hectares in the so-called Northwest Economic Belt, which is reserved for BMW suppliers. The German carmaker itself laid the foundation stone for its electric car plant in Debrecen in mid-2022 and in late summer and autumn 2022 appointed a total of three suppliers to produce the new round-format battery cells in the “New Class” electric models. In addition to Eve Energy, these are CATL and Envision AESC. Together they are to cover the regions of North America, Europe and China with the construction of six factories.

It is now clear that Eve Energy is contributing a plant in Europe. This had already been hinted at: According to reports from late March 2022, Eve Energy had already signed a non-binding letter of intent with the Debrecen Municipality at the time to acquire 45 hectares in an industrial area and build a cylindrical cell production plant there. Most recently, Eve Energy has also made headlines with a strong capacity expansion in China. However, it has not been confirmed whether the announced new buildings will include an exclusive plant for BMW.

What is clear, however, is that Envision AESC will cover the North American cell deliveries for BMW. An Envision AESC factory announced in October for South Carolina with up to 30 GWh will be the company’s first of two planned production facilities in the region dedicated to BMW supply. CATL is expected to complement Eve Energy in its supply activities in Europe and China. Details are not yet available. But: CATL is also setting up a 100 GWh factory in Debrecen, with Mercedes as a major customer.

BMW’s round cells will have a uniform diameter of 46 millimetres and two different heights (format: 46XX). According to BMW, the module level is omitted during installation: the round cells are “integrated flexibly and space-savingly in the installation space”. The storage system takes on a supporting role in the body structure. In technical jargon, this battery concept is called “pack-to-open-body”.

It has been known for some time that the vehicles of the New Class will use an 800-volt system with up to 350 kW charging power in addition to this battery concept. In this way, a significantly increased charging performance can be achieved with direct current charging at a current strength of up to 500 amperes, as BMW recently specified. “The time required for charging from ten to 80 per cent is reduced by up to 30 per cent.”

Eve Power is building its first European plant in Debrecen,2023-05-10 00:00:00,"The world’s ninth largest electric battery manufacturer, China’s Eve Power, will build its first European plant in Debrecen with an investment of about HUF 400 billion, and as a result, more than a thousand new jobs will be created – Péter Szijjártó, Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade, announced.

The head of the ministry reported that the company came at BMW’s request to supply its Hungarian factory with new-generation cylindrical battery cells. The state provides HUF 14 billion in support for the HUF 400 billion projects, thus helping to create more than a thousand new jobs.

He said that 95 percent of the water needs of the environmentally friendly investment will be provided from treated wastewater and surface water, and the company will also recycle part of the technological wastewater on site.

He also announced that the government will finance new significant developments in the city, for example, the water utility system, i.e. water supply and sewage drainage, will be modernized in the amount of HUF 108 billion. “I think that even those who are legitimately concerned about water here can be satisfied,” he said.

Péter Szijjártó emphasized: In Hungary, there is such a broad consensus on a few issues regarding the importance of environmental protection.

“The government’s clear goal is for Hungary to be a global leader in environmental protection. Our goal is clearly for Hungary to be among the countries that do the most to protect the environment and preserve our planet,” he declared.

In this regard, he recalled the European decisions requiring a green transition and underlined that in order to achieve the goal, the most seriously polluting sources must be eliminated, which also requires the electric transition of road transport, which is responsible for 14 percent of emissions.

“Without electric cars, the European Green Agreement cannot be a success, and there are no electric cars without electric batteries (.) Then the cause of environmental protection is simply lost and the fight we are waging against global climate change is lost,” he pointed out.

The minister believed that since the demand will increase tenfold by 2030, the only question is where the electric battery factories will be built in Europe and who will benefit from them.

“A country that can attract the construction of electric battery factories will have a long-term guarantee that its economy will grow,” he stated, adding that the competition for investments in the sector is huge, and countries will do everything to win them.

“When we say that they are doing everything, there are correct means and incorrect means. For example, misleading people and groundless fear-mongering are not correct means,” he said.

“It is clear that the safety of their own place of residence is the most important thing for people. This is a completely legitimate feeling, but taking advantage of this in an unfair way is no longer correct and cannot be tolerated,” he underlined.

“Therefore, I would like to state here that the people of Debrecen have nothing to fear because of the construction of electric battery factories. In Hungary, we apply much stricter environmental protection standards than in Europe,” he said.

“Anyone who does not agree to comply with these rules simply cannot build a factory in Hungary,” he added.

Péter Szijjártó stated: “The German-Chinese cooperation taking place here also clearly shows how much better it is if the world is about interconnection and not about blocking”.

“I thank Debrecen, the city leaders of Debrecen, for always keeping the interests of the people of Debrecen in mind, for not allowing themselves to be misled, and for ensuring that Debrecen’s development will be unbroken in the years to come,” he concluded his speech.

According to Eve Power’s announcement on Tuesday, the factory will be built on 45 hectares in the North-West Economic Zone reserved for BMW suppliers by 2026. The company promises to install world-class knowledge and market-leading technology in Debrecen, so the battery cells produced here will also meet the highest quality requirements. The factory will have a production capacity of 28-gigawatt hours (GWh) per year.

The company will produce a new type of high-performance battery cells with a diameter of 46 millimeters for electric BMWs, which will be smaller, lighter and 20 percent denser than those currently used, which will increase the range by 30 percent. These 6th-generation batteries will have a 30 percent faster charging speed.

The company uses solar panels and an energy storage system for energy-efficient production, and carbon emissions will also be continuously monitored. Eve Power has long-term cooperation with suppliers that produce some battery elements, such as cathode precursors and anodes, with green energy, they wrote.

EVE Formally Invests in Cylindrical Battery Project in Hungary and Acquires Land for New Project in Malaysia,2017-06-08,"Chinese suppliers for Li-ion batteries are actively internationalize their operations and form strategic partnerships with foreign companies involved in the upstream and downstream sections of the industry chain. On June 8, EVE announced two new developments in its ongoing overseas expansion.

First, the board of EVE issued a notice approving a proposal on building a plant in Hungary for manufacturing cylindrical batteries used in electric passenger vehicles. EVE Power Hungary Kft., a wholly-owned subsidiary, will invest no more than RMB 9.97 billion in setting up the plant. The EVE Power Hungary will be spending its own capital as well as raise the money from other sources for funding this project. Located in Debrecen, the plant would provide a large amount of new production capacity for a new-type of large-sized cylindrical Li-ion battery cells.

EVE said the plant in Debrecen will contribute to its overseas expansion and internationalization of its business operations. Furthermore, the plant will help the company to scale up and optimize production so that it can capture more orders from clients working in the fast-growing field of NEVs. All in all, this investment will enhance the company’s position in the market for NEV power batteries.

Placing a plant in Hungary will allow EVE to promptly respond to the demand from the local vehicle manufacturing plants. Besides this, the plant will radiate EVE’s influence across the whole Europe, providing opportunities for EVE to secure contracts from the major vehicle manufacturers based in the region.

Regarding the other development, EVE also disclosed that progress has been made in setting up a battery production plant in Malaysia. A sub-subsidiary EVE Energy Malaysia Sdn. Bhd. has signed a land purchase agreement with Pemaju Kelang Lama Sdn. Bhd. and its holding subsidiary G&C Utama Sdn. Bhd. In October 2022, the board of EVE approved a proposal on investing in a project for manufacturing cylindrical batteries in Malaysia. To implement this project, EVE would spend its own capital and self-raised funds totaling no more than US$422.3 million (around RMB 3 billion).

EVE said the project in Malaysia leverages the company’s own technological advantages and the country’s advantages in resources, thereby significantly scaling up the production of cylindrical batteries. Moreover, the project will meet the demand from manufacturers for electric scooters and power tools within Malaysia and other parts of the Southeast Asia. Hence, EVE will be able to further reinforce its strong position in the fields of batteries used in electric light vehicles and power tools.

EVE is one of the few battery suppliers that possesses core technologies for both batteries used in consumer electronics and batteries used in NEVs. Furthermore, it is the first Chinese battery supplier that has developed offerings related to 46-series cylindrical batteries and other large-sized ternary batteries. In China, EVE now plans to add new production capacity in Jingmen (Hubei Province), Chengdu (Sichuan Province), and Shenyang (Liaoning Province). Additionally, it has secured confirmation from tier-1 carmakers for the adoption of its batteries. These carmakers include Dayun Automobile and BMW.

Regarding financial performance, EVE’s revenue for 1Q23 came to RMB 11.186 billion, up 66.11% YoY. The company maintains an optimal balance among its three main businesses: consumer batteries, NEV batteries, and energy storage batteries. At the same time, it continues to capture market share and improve its position within the industry in order to drive rapid revenue growth.

EVE Energy Co Ltd, a Chinese battery manufacturer, plans to invest about $1.18 billion to build a battery plant in Debrecen, Hungary, to supply German carmaker BMW's plant in the country.

The planned Debrecen plant, experts said, will mark the latest foray by Chinese battery makers into overseas markets, and show that they are supported by expanding production capacity, advancing technologies and improving services, which also help them secure a significant market share worldwide.

Contemporary Amperex Technology Co Ltd, the world's largest electric vehicle battery maker, announced last year it will invest 7.34 billion euros ($8.04 billion) to build a battery production unit with a capacity of 100 gigawatt-hours in Debrecen to supply European automakers.

EVE Energy, the world's ninth largest battery cell manufacturer by installed capacity, said in a statement on Tuesday it had signed an agreement to buy a 45-hectare tract of land in Debrecen's northwest industrial zone for the production of cylindrical batteries.

EVE Energy will invest around 400 billion Hungarian forints ($1.18 billion) in the project, and Hungary's government will support the project with 14 billion forints, reported Xinhua News Agency, citing Peter Szijjarto, Hungary's minister of foreign affairs and trade, on Tuesday.

The move is to meet the demand for new-generation cylindrical batteries from German carmaker BMW's plant in Hungary, Xinhua said.

Buoyed by growing demand for electric vehicle batteries, an increasing number of Chinese battery makers are expanding their global footprint.

Data from China Business Journal showed a batch of battery makers — CATL, Sunwoda Electronic Co Ltd and EVE Energy — have reportedly established overseas factories with accumulated finished investment of $2.3 billion in the first 11 months of last year.

Zhou Mi, a senior researcher at the Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation in Beijing, attributed the significant increase in China's lithium battery producers' expansion into foreign markets to several factors like an increase in production capacity and technological advancements in lithium battery manufacturing.

""Chinese battery makers have distinct benefits in collaborating with related equipment manufacturers in both the upstream and downstream supply chain segments. They also enjoy an advantage in pricing due to their enhanced production capacity and volume, which also enables them to provide sustainable supply,"" Zhou said.

According to data released by South Korean battery market research firm SNE Research, in the first quarter, carmaker BYD's battery installation surpassed South Korea's LG Energy Solution and ranked second with a 16.2 percent market share worldwide.

In the same period, BYD's battery installation volume hit 21.5 GWh, a 115 percent increase from last year's 10 GWh.

CATL's market share was the highest at 35 percent, and its first-quarter battery installation was 46.6 GWh, a 35.9 percent year-on-year increase from last year's 34.3 GWh. The combined market share of these two companies exceeds 50 percent worldwide, SNE Research said.

""The growing demand for renewable energy and new energy vehicles from major consumer countries has also played a role,"" Zhou said.

Chinese companies, he said, have an edge over their competitors in terms of production scale, efficiency and service, which allow them to supply large quantities of lithium batteries that meet diverse customer needs.",https://global.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202305/11/WS645c28aca310b6054fad2426.html
