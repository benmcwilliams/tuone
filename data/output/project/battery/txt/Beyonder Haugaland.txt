Project progress:
- [beyonder](https://www.beyonder.no/latest-news/beyonder-chooses-norway-instead-of-going-abroad-with-its-large-scale-battery-venture, 2022-04-04): - Beyonder has established a small-scale production line and is now planning a step-by-step factory development, with the potential to create between 500-600 direct jobs initially and up to 2,000 direct jobs in the full-scale factory.
- [haugaland-park](https://haugaland-park.no/2022/04/04/beyonder-selects-haugalandet-norway-for-large-scale-battery-venture/, 2022-04-04): - Beyonder has announced plans for large-scale battery production in Norway, with a small-scale production line already established in Forus, Rogaland. The decision to establish the large-scale factory in Norway marks a significant step forward for the project. The project is in the phase of scaling up the building of the factory, which is expected to create about 500 direct jobs in the industry region of Haugalandet, with a potential of employing approximately 2000 people as production scales up.

- [beyonder](https://www.beyonder.no/latest-news/pilot-production-of-battery-cells-and-supercapacitors-aymt4, 2019-06-13): - The project aims to develop an upscaled pilot production line for battery cells and supercapacitors, including small-scale production of BEYONDER’s own super-active carbon (SAC), electrodes made with SAC, and electrodes made with silicon. These components are to be implemented into battery cells for customers to test. The collaboration with United Green Technology will develop batteries for the wind and solar energy markets in Europe and China. The project is expected to accelerate BEYONDER towards the commercial phase.
