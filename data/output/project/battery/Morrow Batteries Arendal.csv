Morrow Batteries to build 32 GWh battery factory in Norway,2020-12-29 00:00:00,"The location has now been determined for the planned 32 GWh battery cell factory by Norwegian company Morrow Batteries for electric vehicles: The plant will be built in Eyde Energipark in Arendal in the southern Norwegian region of Agder. Construction is scheduled to begin in 2023.

The location decision was revealed in a report by Norwegian broadcaster NRK, according to which, Morrow Batteries had four sites to choose from. According to the decision now made, the “world’s most sustainable battery factory” will be built in Arendal and will employ at least 2,000 workers there, according to the initiators. The first of the four planned expansion stages, each with 8 GWh, is to be completed in 2024, as reported when the plans were presented in June.

It was now reported that the factory will primarily build batteries for the automotive and marine industries. The investment volume is to amount to five billion crowns, the equivalent of around 470 million euros. The project is being supported in part by funds from the EU’s Horizon 2020 research program.

In June, it was announced that Morrow Batteries would initially manufacture cells based on existing technologies. However, in the further expansion stages of the plant, “next-generation battery cell technology” will then also be used. The talk is of developing and industrialising new types of lithium-sulfur battery cells.

Behind the new battery company is a consortium of several Norwegian players. The owners of the startup are the Norwegian energy group Agder Energi and the major entrepreneur Bjørn Rune Gjelstens, who owns, among other things, the waste company Noah AS. The initiator is the environmental organization Bellona, which also has a small stake in the company. The project’s partners also include the research institute SINTEF, the business development company Innovation Norway, the so-called Eyde cluster and several raw material suppliers.

Morrow Batteries wants to profit from the upcoming boom in the electric car sector and at the same time prove that battery cell production can be a sustainable industry. The company already emphasised this when it presented the project in June: “We need to build alternative industries to oil and gas and be able to initiate a green turnaround,” Terje Andersen, CEO of Morrow Batteries, said at the time. In Agder, the initiators of the project have access to energy from hydropower, among other sources. For the lithium-sulfur battery cells, Morrow Batteries also wants to use scrap materials from the Norwegian oil industry in the future. The value chain is to be explicitly different from those in Asia.

Morrow Batteries raises EUR 100 million in new investment round, Arendal, Norway, May 22, 2022",https://batteriesnews.com/morrow-batteries-eur-100-million-investment-round/
A giant leap for Norway as a battery powerhouse,2022-09-26,"Morrow Batteries (Morrow) and Siva are building a battery factory that will contribute to value creation far beyond the battery coast of southern Norway. While laying the cornerstone for Battery Factory 1 in Arendal, Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre said that the new factory will be an essential contribution to the government’s efforts to boost domestic battery production and enable Norway to compete at the global level.

The goal of the government’s battery strategy is clear: Norway wants to be an attractive host country for sustainable and profitable activity along the entire battery value chain and aims to attract the gigafactories themselves. By laying this cornerstone, the Norwegian battery industry has passed another significant milestone for the industrialisation of batteries in the country.



In his celebratory speech, before laying down the corner stone, the Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre said that this is a great day for Arendal, it is a great day for Norway, and also a great day for Europe and beyond. In addition, Støre said that we are writing history in Norway today.

He also emphasized that this day marks the first steps for a new, large and future-oriented workplace that can both help save the climate on the planet, provide jobs for people, and create good local communities and take Norway forward - simply a historic day.

Building a factory in Arendal

Siva – Industrial Development Corporation of Norway – has partnered with Morrow to establish a joint property company to erect the building at Eyde Energipark in Arendal, which will be the first of four construction phases. Battery Factory 1 is being built by Veidekke and will encompass nearly 30,000 m2 of usable floor space.

Siva is a state enterprise owned by the Norwegian Ministry of Trade, Industry, and Fisheries, whose task is to support the government’s industrial policies through various initiatives. Siva is contributing 67 percent of the NOK 480 million property investment.

“Siva has more than 50 years of experience in building forward-looking industry. This construction project addresses many important focus areas for Norway, from increased exports to the green industry and battery production promotion. Today’s event marks the beginning of an exciting and critical project for Norway,” says Siva’s Board Chair Kjell Roland.

Aiming for a gigafactory

“This is a historic day for Morrow, Arendal, and the battery coast of Norway. Once complete, this factory can deliver several million battery cells a year to customers for uses such as energy storage systems. We will also use the factory to qualify Morrow as a supplier to the automotive industry,” says acting CEO Håkon Tanem.

Morrow has already ordered production equipment worth more than NOK 1 billion. The factory will be part of the overall infrastructure for the industrialisation of battery technology and battery production that is currently under construction. In the first half of 2023, Morrow will open Norway’s largest battery research centre in Grimstad. Meanwhile, prototype battery cell production will be underway this autumn at a customer qualification line in South Korea. When the factory building is ready, the customer qualification line will be moved to Arendal.

Morrow’s ambition is to develop and produce better batteries and to be at the forefront of developing new battery and materials technology. Access to renewable energy means that, from day one, the factory will produce some of the most cost-effective and sustainable batteries in the world.

“When Battery Cell Factory 1 is operative, we can take new products from the research and development phase to mass production. So we will soon be very well positioned to take a position in tomorrow’s competitive battery market,” says Håkon Tanem

When the factory starts up, it will have an annual production capacity of 1 gigawatt hour (GWh) of battery cells. Once all four construction phases are done, total capacity is planned to reach 43 GWh. It is estimated that, overall, Morrow’s project will create around 2,500 new jobs over the next six years.

Festive launch

The laying of the cornerstone for Arendal’s new battery factory attracted many curious Arendalites, busloads of schoolchildren, and a host of prominent guests. Veidekke gave demos of their equipment and hosted educational activities for the school children about future jobs. Emrik Andreasson from Arendal International School and Selma Bjelkemyr from The San Franciskus School helped the Prime Minister with the official ceremony. The event was led by Leander B. Larsen (9 years old) and Amalie H. Lilleholt (12 years old) from Child Press Arendal.",https://news.morrowbatteries.com/pressreleases/a-giant-leap-for-norway-as-a-battery-powerhouse-3206789
Morrow Batteries partner with the municipality of Arendal to build battery gigafactory,2021-01-21,"The Norwegian municipality Arendal in Agder county will be the place for the Morrow Giga Factory.



«This plot provides the ideal operational setup for us. Besides the fundamental requirements such as power, infrastructure and water for cooling, it is strategically located right by the highway. With short connections to airports, harbours and suppliers. The short way to Europe, by sea, means that we get a good starting point to develop the world's greenest batteries to the European market», says Terje Andersen.



The first construction phase of the next generation battery factory is set to start in 2023.

A sustainable starting pointMorrow Batteries’ ambition is to be a world-class manufacturer of the most sustainable batteries in the world. Short-distance to raw materials, renewable power and an existing cluster of world-class process industry makes the South of Norway an ideal place for the battery industry.



“This plot is already prepared, regulated and ready for construction. The location will enable us to manufacture cost-effective sustainable batteries with low carbon footprint. The planned industrial route to the harbour is ideal for autonomous electrified transport. And the flexibility in the harbour will contribute to an effective logistic towards our customers”, Andersen explains.



Eyde Energipark offers 950 000 of land with all infrastructure ready for construction. The factory will have minimal/none negative impact on the environment, incl. Statnett (TSO) has recommended Arendal as the preferred site to assure sufficient power with the shortest timeline for completion. The planned size of the factory is 32 GWh (built in four phases) with potential for further expansion



Utilizing Norwegian competitive advantages

Earlier in December the European Commission proposed to modernise EU legislation on batteries with new requirements that batteries placed on the EU market should become sustainable, high-performing and safe all along their entire life cycle.



“The big and increasing demand for electrification in the transport sector and industry processes have made batteries a bottle-neck in the green transition. Home-grown European battery manufacturing is key to a sustainable future going forward. In our concept we have all the necessary resources, says Andersen.",https://news.morrowbatteries.com/pressreleases/morrow-batteries-partner-with-the-municipality-of-arendal-to-build-battery-gigafactory-3206493
Morrow Batteries and ABB to strengthen collaboration on battery manufacturing,2022-09-15,"Morrow Batteries (""Morrow"") and ABB have signed two Memorandum of Understanding agreements to strengthen their collaboration to accelerate the transition to renewable energy sources and the electrification of all sectors of society.

ABB is selected as a non-exclusive preferred supplier of technology for manufacturing and power supply to Morrow to ensure that the planned gigafactory at Eyde Energy Park, outside Arendal, Norway, becomes one of the most cost-effective and sustainable in the world. Furthermore, ABB intends to purchase lithium batteries from Morrow for project deliveries to selected segments and customer groups.

“We know that batteries will play an increasingly important role in the future, and we are therefore very pleased to collaborate on this key technology together with ABB as a leading technology company in electrification and automation that will help accelerate the clean energy transition across industries,” said Håkon Tanem, acting CEO of Morrow.

Increased access to renewable energy is key to realizing the sustainable transition of the economy. Storage and distribution of renewable energy on a large scale are central elements for this transition – but require scalable solutions at a reasonable price. Optimized manufacturing technology and efficient use of renewable energy sources in the value chain are crucial for achieving desired volumes in the long term.

“We look forward to a fruitful collaboration with Morrow. Our experience shows that such start-ups contribute to innovation across industries while helping address the world’s energy challenges,” said Per Erik Holsten, Managing Director ABB Energy Industries – Northern Europe.

ABB Energy Industries intend to use the batteries in energy systems for a range of applications and industries, including e-mobility, hydrogen, offshore wind, oil and gas, and utilities.

Morrow will soon commence construction of its first factory in Arendal, and the intention is that ABB will be a key supplier to several stages, contributing to solutions for cost-effective power supply and utilization of energy at the factory. ABB’s scope of supply may include but is not limited to electrical equipment, automation, robotics, cyber security, security systems, and digitalization.

Håkon Tanem said he appreciates that ABB is collaborating on initiatives that also help secure jobs and support the reindustrialization trend in Norway. “At full capacity, we expect up to 2,500 employees in the coming years”.

Morrow Batteries Commits To New Factory In Norway,2021-05-31 00:00:00,"Sign up for daily news updates from CleanTechnica on email. Or follow us on Google News

After a nearly 1 year search for a place to build a new battery factory in Norway, Morrow Batteries has inked a deal with the city of Arendal, which is located in southern Norway near the North Sea. The agreement came about after the city council agreed unanimously to approve the construction of the factory on 940 acres in the Eyde Energy Park.

“We are very happy that the final agreement has now been signed. It comes as a result of good cooperation and solid political support, Terje Andersen, CEO of Morrow Batteries, tells Elbil, the nickname for the Norwegian Electric Car Association. (Translation by Google.) “The plot in Eyde Energy Park is perfect for us and meets all the needs of a large battery cell factory, such as access to energy, infrastructure and central location in relation to raw materials and markets. We look forward to establishing ourselves in Arendal and to further cooperation.”

Construction of the battery cell factory will take place in 4 stages beginning in 2023. Each stage will have the ability to manufacture 8 GWh of batteries annually, according to Electrive. A pilot plant will be built first on the site starting later this year. According to the plan, the factory will be completed in 2026 and will require a minimum of 315 MW of power capacity, most of which will be supplied by hydro power available in the area. It is expected the factory will create 2,500 direct and indirect jobs for the local economy.

World’s Most Sustainable Battery Factory

The total cost of the new factory will be €470 million, a portion of which will come from the EU’s Horizon 2020 research program. Morrow Batteries says the first phase of the new factory will manufacture conventional lithium-ion battery cells. The later modules, however, will focus on “next-generation battery cell technology” such as lithium-sulfur battery cells which will use scrap materials from the Norwegian oil industry, making the lithium-sulfur value chain significantly different than what is common in Asia.

Morrow claims its new facility will be the most sustainable battery factory in the world. “We need to build alternative industries to oil and gas and be able to initiate a green turnaround,” says Andersen. The site chosen “allows us to build the facilities with a minimal carbon dioxide footprint and with minimal impact on the environment. We will use an old landfill as a parking space and the area for the first factory module is already ready for construction,” he adds.

Arendal mayor Robert Cornels Nordli is enthusiastic about the new factory, which will be designed by Exyte, an internationally recognized consulting company that has participated in more than 15 battery projects around the world for such companies as Tesla, Northvolt, and LG Energy Solution.

“The establishment of Morrow Batteries is the beginning of one of the most important events for Arendal municipality in modern times and our 300 year history,” the mayor says. “We are very pleased that the final agreement has now been approved by both parties. Eyde Energy Park is zoned for industrial purposes, so everything is well located for Morrow’s battery cell factory.”
