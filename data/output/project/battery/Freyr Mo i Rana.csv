A Norwegian Battery Maker Is Moving To The U.S. To Tap Federal Incentives,2023-12-18 00:00:00,"Norwegian battery startup Freyr is hoping that shifting its official base of operations to the U.S. will help overcome financial challenges. Freyr

Freyr, a struggling Norwegian startup hoping to become a global battery powerhouse using a highly automated cell production system, got shareholder approval to become a U.S. company by the end of 2023, which will help it seek federal incentives for clean energy projects.

A majority of investors voted in favor of redomiciling Freyr to Delaware from Luxembourg at a meeting on Friday, the company said in an emailed statement. It had previously announced its intention to move to the U.S. in August, to position itself “to better respond to global tax developments and U.S. incentive programs for battery manufacturers.” It said the change would also simplify its corporate structure and streamline financial reporting requirements.

The approval “will pave the way for us to realize the previously announced benefits to shareholders,” said Tom Einar Jensen, Freyr cofounder and executive chairperson.

Named for the Norse god of fertility, Freyr is currently building Giga America, a $2.5 billion battery plant in Coweta County, Georgia, southwest of Atlanta, that will produce cells for use in stationary energy storage systems, electric vehicles and marine products. The company is prioritizing the U.S. plant over Giga Arctic, a partially built battery factory in Norway, saying last month it will minimize investment there in 2024.

Funding for clean energy projects and battery manufacturing in the U.S. created by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and Inflation Reduction Act has spurred dozens of announcements for new multibillion-dollar battery plants across the country, from General Motors, Ford and Tesla to Toyota, Honda and Hyundai in the past two years. At the same time, tighter new rules that materials used in battery anodes and cathodes of EV batteries be sourced in North America, rather than from China or Russia, to receive tax credits are creating opportunities for companies like Redwood Materials and Sila to supply them.

Freyr opened a small-scale factory line early this year in Mo I Rana, Norway, to start making pouch-type “SemiSolid” lithium-ion cells developed by battery researcher 24M Technologies that it hopes will be up to 25% cheaper than conventional cells when produced in high volume. The company has said its Georgia plant will have the capacity to churn out 34-gigawatt hours of batteries annually when it opens in a few years.

Freyr, with shares already listed on the New York Stock Exchange, is the first battery maker to redomicile in the U.S. since the Biden Administration amped up manufacturing programs to reduce climate-warming carbon emissions from a range of industries.

The news didn’t aid Freyr’s shares, which fell 3.2% to close at $1.82 in New York on Monday.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/alanohnsman/2023/12/18/a-norwegian-battery-maker-is-moving-to-the-us-to-tap-federal-incentives/

FREYR Battery Provides Operations Update,,"FREYR achieves important interim milestone by successfully conducting automated cathode casting trials

FREYR Battery (NYSE: FREY) (“FREYR” or the “Company”), a developer of clean, next-generation battery cell production capacity, has provided an update this morning on the company’s operational progress at the Customer Qualification Plant (“CQP”) in Mo i Rana, Norway.

Successful automated cathode casting trials

Following successful adjustments to the cathode casting equipment that included updates to the vacuum system, last week, FREYR’s teams at the CQP commenced automated cathode casting runs at a minimum nozzle distance of 0.26 mm.

The CQP teams have subsequently conducted successful cathode casting runs using the cathode web and solvent slurry at fixed nozzle distances of 0.5 mm and 1.0 mm, respectively, and at speeds of 2 meters per minute while using 100 psi of casting pressure. These successful automated cathode casting runs with solvent slurry were an important precursor to completing the Casting and Unit Cell Assembly commissioning packages and the eventual start of automated CQP production.

“I am very pleased to share that our teams at the CQP have reached another important interim technical milestone,” commented Mike Brose, FREYR’s Head of the Asset Mo team. “In doing so, our people and partners have demonstrated their collective ability to systematically link small but critical steps together to achieve the required outcome. We are able to integrate this vital part of the SemiSolidTM technology platform only because of the many milestones already completed together over the last several months by the FREYR Asset Mo team, our coworkers around the world, and our valued partners and suppliers. As we look forward to 2024, FREYR’s top priority is to finalize commissioning at the CQP and to begin automated production of in-spec, customer-testable batteries. With this latest milestone behind us, we will continue to apply unwavering focus to the remaining tasks that are necessary to achieve that goal.”

CQP commissioning status and key next steps

Following the successful automated cathode casting trials, FREYR has completed handovers of 342 (88%) of the 388 discrete production line equipment commissioning and testing packages at the CQP. The test center packages and handovers to operations are all complete.

The next technical requirements to stay on track with FREYR’s anticipated completion cadence at the CQP are:

Replicate the successful automated cathode casting trials with the anode production line system; and

Integrate the casting webs across the cathode, anode, and merge units of the Casting and Unit Cell Assembly equipment using the highly complex Multi-Carrier Systems (“MCS”) to reach automated cell production.

FREYR Battery Sanctions Construction of its Inaugural Gigafactory,,"Increases plant capacity to 29 GWh, based on $1.6 billion in identified debt financing support, catalyzed by the Norwegian National Battery Strategy and Norway’s Export Credit Agency Eksfin’s indication of up to EUR 400 million in loans and/or guarantees FREYR’s Board of Directors has sanctioned construction of Giga Arctic (combined Gigafactories 1 & 2), the company’s first battery manufacturing facility under development in Mo i Rana, Norway

FREYR is increasing the nameplate capacity of Giga Arctic to 29 GWh in response to improving battery supply-demand dynamics, ongoing commercial success, significant progress in developing supply chain channels for key raw materials and equipment, continued technical and product improvements, and project financing visibility

Earlier today at FREYR’s development site in Mo i Rana, the Norwegian Government outlined its National Battery Strategy, which includes significant support from Export Finance Norway (“Eksfin”) to assist FREYR with project financing of Giga Arctic

FREYR has identified total debt financing support of over $1.6 billion based on visibility from export credit agencies, multilateral development finance institutions and commercial banking partners, exceeding management’s leverage target for the $1.7 billion estimated total capital cost for the expanded Giga Arctic project

FREYR intends to contract approximately 50% of Giga Arctic’s capacity to long-term offtake partners and reserve the remaining volumes to address exponentially growing market demand, providing annual revenue generating capacity of $2 billion upon optimization of production systems and cell chemistry

Giga Arctic is expected to be one of the largest and most efficient battery facilities in Europe, with 50% lower anticipated capital spending per GWh of nameplate capacity and more than 200% higher production per employee than conventional Lithium-Ion battery plants in production today

FREYR is raising its installed annual production capacity target to more than 200 GWh by 2030, twice the company’s previous ambition

FREYR has recently secured a conditional offtake agreement (“COA”) with a major European energy technology customer for 25 GWh of battery cells from 2024 to 2028, in addition to the more than 100 GWh of previously announced COAs

FREYR Battery (NYSE: FREY) (“FREYR”), a developer of clean, next-generation battery cell production capacity, announced today that the company’s Board of Directors (“The Board”) has approved the expansion of the planned Giga Arctic project under development in Mo i Rana, Norway, to an annual nameplate capacity of 29 GWh. FREYR’s Board of Directors has also approved the construction of Giga Arctic. The approval follows substantial completion of detailed plant engineering; the establishment of procurement frameworks with key raw material and capital equipment suppliers; and the announcements of conditional offtake agreements totaling more than 125 GWh from the planned start of production in 1H-2024 through 2030. Groundworks at the site are well advanced and the company has recently started casting foundation structures.

The Board’s decision coincides with the announcement of a letter of intent indicating loans and/or guarantees of up to €400 million from Eksfin, Norway’s export credit agency (“ECA”), and the recently announced National Battery Strategy by the Norwegian Government, which outlines meaningful governmental support for the developing battery industry in Norway.

“If we are to reach the goals in the Paris agreement, batteries will need to be produced in a more sustainable way with the lowest CO2 footprint possible. It is therefore important for Norway to define a clear direction and set ambitious goals for battery production in our country. The National Battery Strategy that we just launched, defines ten areas of key importance that will facilitate private investments so that companies along the entire value chain can set up sustainable and successful businesses in Norway. Our unmatched access to renewable energy makes batteries produced in Norway the greenest in the world. I am therefore very pleased and excited that FREYR Battery is moving along with its plans to establish a Gigafactory in Norway based on state capital and risk relief. It is an important confirmation that public and private partnerships are important to be successful in creating the green industry of the future,” said the Minister of Trade and Industry, Jan Christian Vestre.

“Today marks another significant milestone for FREYR on our path to giga-scale production of clean battery solutions. With our expanded plant capacity, accelerating commercial momentum, and strong support from Eksfin, other ECAs and financial institutions, Giga Arctic represents one of Norway’s largest industrial investments onshore in recent decades,” said Torstein Dale Sjøtveit, Founder and Executive Chairman of FREYR.

Governmental Support and Gigafactory Financing Plan

Today, the Norwegian Government announced the key elements of its National Battery Strategy at FREYR’s facilities in Mo i Rana, Norway. With the expected financial backing catalyzed by this strategy and support from other European governmental entities, FREYR has identified over $1.6 billion of potential debt financing support to fund development of Giga Arctic, including:

A letter of intent received from Eksfin indicating loans and/or guarantees of up to €400 million;

Anticipated loan guarantees exceeding $800 million from ECAs of three OECD countries based on capital equipment order frameworks for Giga Arctic from the same plant equipment suppliers to FREYR’s Customer Qualification Plant;

Indications of support received from multilateral development finance institutions, which include potential loans of $300 million from the European Investment Bank (“EIB”) and $50 million to $100 million from the Nordic Investment Bank (“NIB”), respectively; and

Targeted project financing from a consortium of commercial banks led by initial mandated lead arrangers Societe Generale and DNB, which are now formally launching the project financing process.

In addition, FREYR had $523 million of cash on its balance sheet as of March 31, 2022, and currently has multiple grant applications pending decision.

Tone Lunde Bakker, Chief Executive Officer of Eksfin, added, “Export Finance Norway's most important task is to offer capital and risk relief to the green, Norwegian export industry. Long-term partnerships between state and private capital are needed to realize the transition to a zero-emission society; create local jobs; and take leading positions internationally. FREYR Battery’s factory can play a key role in building a powerful, high-tech value chain within batteries in Norway and the Nordic countries. Eksfin has therefore indicated participation in the financing of the project in collaboration with other financiers and investors. We wish FREYR good luck in the next, exciting phase and look forward to working closely with the growing Norwegian battery industry.”

Giga Arctic Development

The sanctioned Giga Arctic construction project includes eight production lines, a battery testing center, administrative facilities, and infrastructure at an estimated total capital cost of $1.7 billion. The updated cost relative to FREYR’s initial business plan, which was finalized in February 2021, is attributable to the following:

A 150% increase in nameplate capacity on a chemistry equivalent basis to 29 GWh from the initial plan to construct two smaller Gigafactories in Mo i Rana 1 ;

; Technical modifications and enhancements to the plant and its products that are intended to improve operational efficiency and economic returns; and

Inflationary pressures and supply chain challenges.

FREYR has engineered and positioned Giga Arctic to be the most capital efficient battery plant in Europe, with 50% lower estimated capital expenditures per installed GWh of capacity compared to plants currently in operation or under construction. The company also expects Giga Arctic to be the most operationally efficient battery plant in Europe, generating an anticipated 200% higher production per plant employee compared to estimated averages at conventional Lithium-Ion battery facilities. These expected efficiencies are aided by FREYR’s recently announced long-term power purchase agreement (“PPA”) with Statkraft. Giga Arctic is expected to benefit from 100% renewable energy at prices that FREYR estimates to be substantially below those of other battery producing regions, while using less energy in production through the 24M Technologies SemiSolidTM cell manufacturing process and platform.

FREYR is also evaluating additional enhancements to the Giga Arctic development that include module and pack manufacturing, recycling and other applications which could add approximately $250 million of additional capital expenditures. Management expects the above investments to generate highly accretive returns on capital for the project should the company move forward with these initiatives. In addition, the company continues to evaluate its proposed joint venture with Aleees for a Nordic LFP cathode materials manufacturing plant.

Tom Einar Jensen, FREYR’s Chief Executive Officer, concluded, “Since our NYSE listing in July 2021, FREYR has made incredible progress on its goal of providing clean battery solutions to the world through speed, scale, and sustainability. Despite supply chain challenges and inflation, the fundamentals have never been better for the battery industry given the largest secular shift in human history towards the energy transition to address the climate emergency; the immediate need for energy security, localized power generation and storage; and the accelerating adoption of electric vehicles and battery energy storage systems. FREYR is playing a key role in addressing energy cost inflation, energy security and climate change.”
