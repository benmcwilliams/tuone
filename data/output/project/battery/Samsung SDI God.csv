Stellantis and Samsung SDI to Invest Over $2.5 Billion in Joint Venture for Lithium-Ion Battery Production Plant in United States,,"KOKOMO, Indiana, United States – Stellantis N.V. and Samsung SDI today announced that they have executed binding, definitive agreements to establish an electric-vehicle battery manufacturing facility in Kokomo, Indiana, U.S. Targeted to start in 2025, the plant aims to have an initial annual production capacity of 23 gigawatt hours (GWh), with an aim to increase to 33 GWh in the next few years. The total capacity would increase further as demand for Stellantis electric vehicles is expected to rise.

The joint venture company will invest over $2.5 billion (€2.3 billion) and create 1,400 new jobs in Kokomo and the surrounding areas. The investment could gradually increase up to $3.1 billion (€2.9 billion). The new facility will supply battery modules for a range of vehicles produced at Stellantis’ North American assembly plants. Plant construction activities are scheduled to begin later this year with production operations planned to launch in the first quarter of 2025.

“Just under one year ago, we committed to an aggressive electrification strategy anchored by five gigafactories between Europe and North America,” said Carlos Tavares, CEO of Stellantis. “Today’s announcement further solidifies our global battery production footprint and demonstrates Stellantis’ drive toward a decarbonized future outlined in Dare Forward 2030. I am grateful to Governor Holcomb and Secretary Chambers along with Mayor Moore, and their teams as well as to all my colleagues for their support and dedication to bring this operation to Kokomo, a city that holds a rich and long history for our company.”

“We express our gratitude towards officials from the State of Indiana and Stellantis for supporting the final selection of the plant site in Indiana,” said YOONHO CHOI, chief executive officer of Samsung SDI. “We have secured a solid foothold in a rapidly growing North American EV market through the joint venture with Stellantis. We will make sincere efforts to bring satisfaction to the market with top-class quality products in the future, and we will contribute towards meeting the climate change target.”

“It’s another incredibly exciting day to be back in Kokomo celebrating such a transformational investment from Stellantis and our new partners at Samsung,” said Gov. Holcomb. “Today’s announcement is another step toward positioning Indiana as a leader in the future of mobility, battery technology and clean energy.”

“Our goals for the growth of Indiana’s economy are ambitious,” said Brad Chambers, secretary of commerce for Indiana Economic Development Corporation. “This significant venture with Stellantis and Samsung SDI is squarely in line with our 5E focus on the energy transition and building an economy of the future. Large-scale investments like this are a testament to Indiana’s business-friendly climate, its strong workforce, a growing population and our continued investment in quality of life. The economic growth and momentum in our state this year is unprecedented.”

“We would like to thank our partner, Stellantis, for its continued investment, support, and faith in this community for over 85 years,” said Tyler Moore, Mayor of Kokomo. “We would also like to thank Samsung SDI for its confidence in us and look forward to working together for the decades to come. This multi-billion dollar investment will help solidify Kokomo as a global leader in automotive manufacturing.”

At the Indiana factory, Samsung SDI will be applying its cutting-edge technology PRiMX to producing EV battery cells and modules for the North American market. Samsung has launched its premium battery technology brand PRiMX as an industry’s first last year and unveiled the brand at CES 2022 in January.

As part of the Dare Forward 2030 strategic plan, Stellantis announced plans to have global annual battery electric vehicle sales of five million vehicles by 2030, reaching 100% of passenger car BEV sales mix in Europe and 50% passenger car and light-duty truck BEV sales mix in North America. Stellantis also increased planned battery capacity by 140 GWh to approximately 400 GWh, to be supported by five battery manufacturing plants together with additional supply contracts. This announcement is part of the long-term electrification strategy to invest $35 billion (€30 billion) through 2025 in electrification and software globally.

The closing is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals.

Samsung SDI expands battery production in Hungary,2021-02-24,"The Korean battery cell manufacturer Samsung SDI has announced that it will invest the equivalent of around 740 million euros in the expansion of its battery factory in Göd, Hungary, near Budapest.

The factory, from which Samsung SDI supplies cells for BMW and Volkswagen, among others, currently has an annual capacity of 30 GWh and is expected to be able to produce over 40 GWh in the future. Samsung SDI had completed the construction of the factory in 2017. It is not clear from the South Korean media reports when the expansion is to be completed.

With the investment of around one trillion won, which is equivalent to a little more than 900 million US dollars or the aforementioned 740 million euros, the Korean company apparently hopes to expand its position in the electric car market in Europe. The investment is to be partly financed by a capital increase of the Hungarian subsidiary Samsung SDI Hungary Zrt, but also by loans.

In South Korea, an unnamed representative of Samsung SDI told the Reuters news agency that the manufacturer was also considering building a second plant in Hungary. However, a decision or even a timetable for the construction of such a factory had not yet been made. In addition to Hungary, Samsung SDI has plants in South Korea and China. Worldwide, Samsung SDI ranks fifth among battery cell manufacturers.

Samsung SDI's $1.98 Billion Investment Accelerates Entry into US EV Battery Market,,"Battery manufacturer Samsung SDI is making a significant foray into the U.S. electric vehicle (EV) battery market, announcing plans to invest $1.98 billion in its second battery factory in collaboration with Stellantis, a leading global automaker. This strategic move was unveiled in a regulatory filing by the South Korea-based company on September 27.

The investment is slated to span from April to November 2027, marking a substantial commitment to the rapidly growing EV sector. It will also grant Samsung SDI a commanding 51% ownership stake in Starplus Energy, a joint venture with Stellantis dedicated to producing batteries for electric vehicles. This increased ownership share reflects Samsung SDI's drive to strengthen its presence in the EV battery market.

While Samsung SDI has yet to provide detailed comments on this development, the move aligns with the company's broader expansion strategy in the US. This expansion drive recently gained momentum with an announcement from the state of Mich.. Samsung SDI will invest $41 million to expand two of its existing facilities in Auburn Hills, Mich., a move aimed at doubling the manufacturing capacity of these plants. Furthermore, this expansion initiative is expected to create approximately 368 new job opportunities in the region.

Samsung SDI America's general counsel and vice president of legal and public affairs, Joe Pittel, expressed enthusiasm about the expansion, stating, ""This expansion plan, critical to our operations, will allow us to better support our customers and will result in hundreds of new jobs for those eager to take part in the electrification revolution.""

This news comes on the heels of the joint endeavor between Samsung SDI and Stellantis to construct a massive $2.5 billion EV battery production plant in Kokomo, Indiana. This ambitious facility is anticipated to commence production in 2025, with a projected annual capacity of 23 gigawatt hours. The plant's design also incorporates the flexibility to ramp up production to 33 GWh annually, showcasing the partners' commitment to meeting the growing demand for EV batteries in the US market.",https://www.sme.org/technologies/articles/2023/september/samsung-sdis-$1.98-billion-investment-accelerates-entry-into-us-ev-battery-market/

GM and Samsung partner to build a new $3 billion battery cell factory in the US,2023-04-25,"GM and Samsung SDI have announced that they are partnering to build a new $3 billion battery cell factory in the US to power GM’s electric vehicles.

It’s a change for GM, which has so far been mostly partnered with LG Energy for its battery cell supply.

For the last few years, GM has been heavily investing in battery manufacturing in the US in order to support its transition to electric vehicles.

It partnered with Korea’s LG to create Ultium Cells, a new joint venture to build battery cells in the US.

The partnership has already resulted in three battery factories in the US that are now in production or construction phases. There’s one in Ohio, one in Tennessee, and one in Michigan.

GM and LG have been working on a fourth US battery factory, but it was reported in January that the plan for a new battery plant in the US is on hold “indefinitely” after talks between GM and LG failed to move forward.

GM now partners with Samsung SDI

Now GM is announcing a partnership with Samsung SDI to build a new battery cell factory in the US:

General Motors Co. and Samsung SDI announced today they plan to invest more than $3 billion to build a new battery cell manufacturing plant in the United States that is targeted to begin operations in 2026.

In a press release, GM announced that the new factory will have a capacity of “more than 30 GWh” and it will bring GM’s total capacity in the US to about 160 GWh.

Interestingly, GM and Samsung are talking about building production lines to build both “nickel-rich prismatic and cylindrical cells.”

Doug Parks, GM executive vice president, Global Product Development, Purchasing and Supply Chain, commented:

We will continue to scale production and optimize the chemistry of our pouch cells for performance, range and cost using new approaches pioneered at GM’s Wallace Battery Center and by our technology partners. The introduction of new cell form factors will allow us to expand into even more segments more quickly and integrate cells directly into battery packs to reduce weight, complexity and costs. With multiple strong cell partners, we can scale our EV business faster than we could going it alone.

GM and Samsung SDI are not ready to disclose where in the US the new factory will be located.

Electrek’s Take

It’s an interesting development. GM seemed to have one of the strongest battery cell partnerships in the US with LG Energy through its Ultium Cells joint venture.

That partnership was certainly shaken by the Bolt EV battery recall, but it seemed to still be going strong. And it might still be going strong.

This might be just a smart move from GM to diversify its battery cell supply chain.",https://electrek.co/2023/04/25/gm-samsung-sdi-build-battery-cell-factory-us/
