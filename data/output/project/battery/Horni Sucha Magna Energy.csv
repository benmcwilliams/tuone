The grand opening of the MES HE3DA battery factory will take place in September,2020-06-23 00:00:00,"On Thursday September 17, 2020, a long-anticipated ceremony of global significance will take place in Horní Suchá near Havířov in the north of the Czech Republic, when the Magna Energy Storage (MES) manufacturing plant for the unique Czech Li-Ion HE3DA batteries will be declared officially open. With the expected participation of almost a thousand guests from all over the world, the opening of this facility will herald the fulfillment of the long-term dream and vision of the notable Czech inventor Ing. Jan Procházka, whose ingenious work as a leading nanotechnologist and inventor of the HE3DA 3D battery has already brought widespread acclaim and recognition in both Europe and abroad.​

According to project financier and majority shareholder Radomír Prus: ‘’The HE3DA battery was ranked in the TOP 10 among tens of thousands of projects in the worldwide NASA iTech 2019 competition. This is a truly unique project that has already attracted many investors, enabling us to be now opening the largest battery plant in Europe, and making the Czech Republic one of the global leaders in the energy storage segment. We are currently finalizing production technologies and subjecting our batteries to a series of tests. We anticipate their widespread use in many fields, from energy backup in hospitals to energy balancing and ‘island’ systems, through applications in the car, truck, and maritime transport industries and even for NASA space projects. Although the protective measures against COVID-19 will not permit some invited personalities from further afield to participate in the opening, we’re sure it will not impede the progress of our international expansion.”

The author of the HE3DA patent, Ing. Jan Procházka, added: “By starting production in Horní Suchá, we want to show the world that we can bring our discoveries into commercial production. We’re offering a safe, nonflammable battery technology, which is almost 100% recyclable. Furthermore, we have other ideas and inventions which we’re currently working on that could also serve to significantly improve life on our planet.”

The HE3DA production processes in the Magna Energy Storage factory will be one of the first to be completely robotized and automated, and will fully meet the requirements for Industry 4.0 qualification. It is a prime example of modern commercial investment techniques, making room for the emergence of new industries that will benefit the lives of millions of people in the near future.

HE3DA battery production, to begin, will serve as energy storage banks in two initial areas of demand: firstly as modular units for on-demand energy storage installations, and in the second stage as efficient, purpose made powerpacks for the electric vehicle industry.

The opening of a state-of-the-art and wholly Czech conceived and realized factory in the Moravian-Silesian region of the Czech Republic, is an example for all those who are not afraid to turn their ideas into reality.

During the grand opening of the factory, the invited participants will have the opportunity to make priority reservations for forthcoming home energy storage systems. Other revolutionary inventions will be presented on the day as forthcoming product developments from HE3DA’s long and painstaking research in the battery technology sector.",https://www.magnastorage.cz/single-post/2020/06/23/The-grand-opening-of-the-MES-HE3DA-battery-factory-will-take-place-in-September

New thin-walled battery cell manufactured on the serial production line in Horní Suchá,2021-06-30 13:19:29.186000+00:00,"Another type of battery has been produced in our Magna Energy Storage manufacturing plant, which will be mass-produced. Experience from development in HE3DA laboratories in Prague was used in the production of this battery.





The battery is light, in dry condition it weighs only 7.2 kg at 1.1 kWh capacity. In the total pack, the weight capacity should reach 110 Wh/kg.





This battery is designed mainly for heavy equipment – trucks, off-road vehicles, special applications. Its charging speed meets the requirements currently imposed on electric cars.





The new battery will also be tested in racing vehicles and other applications.





The peak currents of the battery reach up to 3000 A, which means that the batteries can spin any electric motor. Continuous currents are up to 400 A. In serial connection, the voltage reaches up to 1000 V. Thin-walled batteries have both internal and external high voltage protection.





With this battery, we have achieved an optimal weight-to-speed ratio, charging and discharging.

Thanks to nanomaterials and its construction, it should have a long service life in trucks, according to simulations of at least 1.5 – 2 million km.





Already this year, we plan to produce this battery on a smaller serial production line. By the end of 2022, if all goes according to plan, production will start on a large serial production line for mass production.





This new line (third in line) will have a power output of 100 MWh per year. We already have demand from customers for its entire capacity.





The price of the battery is likely to be higher than that of the already produced Robusta type, as it is a special battery type.





In cooperation with our partners, we will present our new battery cell type next year by implementing it into a truck.





We expect the HE3DA thin-walled battery to make a positive contribution to the development of electric truck transport.

“I am really glad that we managed to complete a difficult phase that lasted for several years and that we are moving into the commercial phase. It will bring not only money to the north of Moravia, but also other business in the form of related factories. We come in time to set the direction in the development of energy. For the local region and the Czech Republic, this is undoubtedly a big step forward, and it is important that added value remains with us. We are starting to hold global technological leadership in this field – we are at the top of the pyramid, “said the author of the patent, Czech scientist and inventor Jan Procházka.

As part of the grand opening, a tour of the factory took place, and participants had the opportunity to see not only the batteries themselves, but also to get acquainted with the final solutions in the form of domestic and industrial storage and fast charging stations for electric cars.",https://www.world-today-news.com/look-at-a-brand-new-he3da-battery-factory-has-opened-in-horni-sucha/
Stavba továrny na baterie budoucnosti začala. V Horní Suché dokáží zpracovat všechno české lithium,2023-12-19,"Ostrá výroba by se měla rozběhnout na konci roku 2019. Řekli to zástupci společnosti HE3DA. Továrna by podle nich v budoucnu mohla zpracovat prakticky celou produkci lithia vytěženého z Cínovce.

Závod bude mít roční kapacitu výroby 1,2 gigawatthodiny. Předseda představenstva MES Václav Binar řekl, že se ale plánuje rozšíření kapacity až na 15 gigawatthodin, přičemž do budoucna je na území slezského brownfieldu reálné rozšíření až na 30 gigawatt. Plně robotizovaná továrna má být nejekologičtějším provozem svého druhu na světě. Akumulátory budou určeny hlavně na export.

Procházka řekl, že za dva roky bude v závodě pracovat 250 kvalifikovaných lidí, po rozšíření výroby pak další stovky. „Začneme s cizím lithiem, ale chceme přejít kompletně na domácí. Jenom ta první hala bude zpracovávat čtvrtinu, později třetinu, a ta o mnoho větší hala, která se pak bude stavět, tak fakticky by spotřebovala celou produkci lithia z Cínovce,“ řekl Procházka.

Náměstek ministra průmyslu a obchodu Jiří Koliba sdělil, že cílem ministerstva je zajistit finální výrobu ze všech surovin, které se v ČR dají vydobýt, případně recyklovat, a jednou z nich je právě lithium z Krušných hor. „Pokud je tu máme, je nezbytně potřeba, aby se na území České republiky zpracovávalo nejen do úrovně polotovarů, to jsou ty různé uhličitany lithné a další věci, ale až do stadia finálního produktu, to znamená prakticky použitelné baterie,“ řekl Koliba.

Podle Procházky by bylo ideální, kdyby se na zpracování lithia do aktivních materiálů podílely české chemičky. „Zde by ty materiály šly do baterií, odsud do celého světa a vracely by se. My hodláme vykupovat jádra po skončení životnosti baterií a tady je recyklovat, takže co by se vyváželo, je čistě jenom přidaná hodnota, to znamená ekonomičtěji už to asi nejde,“ řekl Procházka.",https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/regiony/2275570-stavba-tovarny-na-baterie-budoucnosti-zacala-v-horni-suche-dokazi-zpracovat-vsechno
