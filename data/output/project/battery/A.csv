Unlocking the growth opportunity in battery manufacturing equipment,2022-05-03,"Recent breakthroughs in e-mobility will result in unprecedented demand for electric vehicles (EVs), despite the economic and supply disruptions that resulted from the COVID-19 crisis. With this rising demand will come a huge jump in demand for batteries. Battery manufacturing is ramping up around the world to match local demand. To serve European EV manufacturing, established battery cell companies and emerging startups have announced plans to build combined production capacity of up to 965 gigawatt-hours (GWh) per year in Europe by 2030âaccounting for 28 percent of 2030âs announced global capacity of around 3,500 GWh and increasing 20-fold from 2020.

Share About the authors This article is a collaborative effort by Jakob Fleischmann, Dorothee Herring, Ruth Heuss, Friederike Liebach, and Martin Linder, representing views from McKinseyâs Advanced Electronics Practice.

To meet growing demand, roughly 30 new battery-manufacturing facilities will need to come online across Europe, requiring up to â¬100 billion in capital expenditures (Exhibit 1). Roughly 60 percent of the total investment will be earmarked for battery cell manufacturing equipment. This translates to a â¬5 billion to â¬7 billion annual business opportunity for the manufacturing-equipment industry in Europe by 2025 and â¬7 billion to â¬9 billion in the second half of the decade.

In the battery cell manufacturing process, three steps require roughly equal shares of capital expenditures: 35 to 45 percent for electrode-manufacturing equipment, 25 to 35 percent for cell-assembly-and-handling equipment, and 30 to 35 percent for cell-finishing equipment (Exhibit 2). Some processes, such as coating and electrolyte filling, are either unique or highly specific to battery cell manufacturing. These processes require clean- and dry-room conditions and expertise in, for example, high-accuracy thin-layer deposition. Other processes, such as slitting, cell formation, and aging, are similar to processes that are widely used in other industries or require intramanufacturing-logistics equipment.

A looming equipment supply shortage

Today, only a handful of companies that specialize in battery cell manufacturing equipmentâused for slurry mixing, electrode manufacturing, cell assembly, and cell finishingâare operating in Europe; the majority are in China, Japan, and South Korea (Exhibit 3). However, most of these incumbent battery cell manufacturing suppliers are operating at more than 95 percent capacity, leaving little room to increase output. Moreover, they may prioritize orders from established customers (mostly leading incumbent cell manufacturers) over those from new market entrants from Europe and the United States. As a result, European battery cell manufacturing companies and EV OEMs who enter the field are likely to face a bottleneck in equipment supply that will place their planned start of production at risk. Securing equipment supply is a key success factor.

European equipment manufacturers have an opportunity to capture a fair share of the revenue pool by becoming key suppliers to established cell manufacturers that are expanding into Europe and the United States, as well as to newly founded battery manufacturers, given their geographic proximity, which facilitates the installation, ramp-up, and support for equipment. Equipment manufacturers that already sell the needed equipment could expand their capacity to meet surging demand and approach existing and new customers. Meanwhile, manufacturers that do not currently sell the equipment needed to produce battery cells could leverage their existing machinery and equipment expertise from similar processes to pivot into this market. This article discusses the anticipated shortfall in equipment and presents options for equipment suppliers to fill this void.

Responding to the urgent need for equipment and capturing the funding tailwind

EV OEMs and battery cell manufacturing companies will need manufacturing equipment to ramp up production fast and to ensure high factory production performance. Since the majority of announced new gigafactories have planned to start production prior to 2025, companies are making buying decisions about manufacturing equipment supply now. Furthermore, the emergence of new battery cell manufacturing companies planning to build gigafactories unlocks opportunities for equipment manufacturers to secure new supply contracts, rather than compete solely based on existing relationships with incumbent battery cell manufacturers.

The European Green Deal, national support schemes, pressure from activist investors, and broad stakeholder support for sustainable energy coalesce to give battery manufacturing equipment suppliers attractive access to public and private funding. Equipment manufacturers can take advantage of this favorable environment to support their growth plans in the battery cell industry. However, competition among equipment suppliers will intensify, requiring all involved stakeholders to carefully assess their existing operations and capabilities and craft strategies to make the most of this unprecedented opportunity.

Opportunities for equipment manufacturers to pivot

While equipment manufacturers that already have expertise and capacity for battery manufacturing equipment can use the beneficial funding environment to grow their businesses, others can capture the opportunity by pivoting their competencies.

Equipment suppliers to industries whose manufacturing process steps are comparable to those of battery cell production have a particularly advantageous starting position to pursue the battery opportunity. The high-capital-expenditure coating and drying process, for example, requires high-accuracy thin-layer deposition, with some similarities to what is needed in the paper, tape, glass, and technical textileâmanufacturing equipment industries.

Cell assembly, which entails punching, stacking, winding, welding, and sealing, is relatively less specific to battery manufacturing, and more similar to general manufacturing and automation processes. The growth opportunity in battery cell manufacturing equipment can thus become an attractive opportunity for machinery companies looking for new growth markets to which they can transfer their existing skills and expertise.

Approaches for developing the competencies needed to compete

European equipment manufacturers looking to pivot to or expand in the battery cell equipment market can consider four pathways to developing the competencies they will need to effectively compete:

Build organically. Companies should analyze which of their existing competencies and skills can be applied or readily adapted to battery manufacturing processes and then choose which opportunities to pursue based on attractiveness and fit. They may pursue an entire manufacturing processâsuch as electrode manufacturing, cell assembly, or cell finishingâor a subset of steps within any of those processes. Building organically requires sufficient management attention and resources to accelerate the time to market. The best catalyst to create this situation is a sizable lighthouse project at the start.

Acquire. To fill gaps, companies can also acquire all or part of one or more existing battery manufacturing equipment companies, assuming the targets have the desired competencies and resources and can successfully integrate into the existing business. A prominent example is Tesla, which acquired equipment specialist Grohmann Engineering to secure access to equipment supply and know-how for its new gigafactories.

Establish strategic partnerships. European equipment manufacturers can collaborate with other companies to build competencies in battery equipment. One prominent approach is to partner with a foreign supplier of cell manufacturing equipment that seeks to establish a local footprint and increase its capacity. For example, German mechanical-engineering company DÃ¼rr is expanding its market access to battery manufacturers through a partnership with Techno Smart, a leading Japanese manufacturer of coating systems. Another option is for two European companies to team up to expand their offerings. For example, in early 2021 Manz AG and GROB agreed on strategic cooperation in the field of lithium-ion battery systems to provide turnkey solutions.

Establish joint ventures. Companies can jointly develop competencies in a dedicated new entity, assuming the partners have the complementary competencies needed to develop the new expertise, the entity is fully dedicated to this purpose, and all partners allocate sufficient resources and attention to the entity. In such instances, the joint-venture partner could also be the lighthouse project customer.

Determined equipment players, such as Manz, can strategically combine multiple pathways for accelerated and effective building of battery know-how, including acquisitions and strategic cooperation with both European and Asian partners. Likewise, DÃ¼rr took the first step into battery equipment around 2018, supported by the acquisition of American companies MEGTEC and Universal. Through the acquisition, DÃ¼rr gained competencies in coating systems for lithium-ion battery electrodes, which it further expanded through its strategic partnership with Techno Smart.

The leading equipment companies pay close attention to industry developments and battery manufacturer moves, seek partnerships, and join research initiatives and focused alliances.

Jump-start the opportunity

Equipment companies that are leading in the development of battery competencies exhibit several common characteristics:

Eagerness to scout opportunities. The leading equipment companies pay close attention to industry developments and battery manufacturer moves, seek partnerships, and join research initiatives and focused alliances.

Customer access. They have a deep understanding of requirement specifications of automotive OEMsâwhich are increasingly becoming gigafactory ownersâand of battery-cell manufacturers, which determine the specifications of the manufacturing process.

Willingness to partner. They build successful partnerships with complementary equipment manufacturers and with customers to jointly develop new competencies. Partnerships can qualify manufacturers to provide integrated, ready-to-use equipment solutions, an increasingly important selection criterion for battery manufacturers and EV OEMs.

Deep product understanding. They build deep expertise of battery cell technology and follow the latest innovations, which allows them to align their equipment offerings to their customersâ increasingly complex design specifications. Going forward, manufacturing processes could even enable cell technology advancements such as high-silicon-content anodes (which may require prelithiation) and semisolid and solid-state batteries.

European manufacturers that are considering entering the battery cell manufacturing equipment market have numerous pathways to consider, but each requires moving quickly to avoid getting locked out of what promises to be a sizable and lucrative market. Now is the time to act as financing solidifies and gigafactory construction plans move forward. After carefully analyzing the competencies needed at each stage and substage of the battery cell manufacturing process, companies can assess whether they have the necessary expertise to address this new market demand, or can transfer or pivot adjacent expertise. Those that do not can still leverage their advantaged positions to participate through a strategic partnership, joint venture, or combination of the two. The best way to burnish your reputation, learn by doing, and establish a foothold from which to expand is to initiate a project with an existing customer or partner and deliver above expectations with respect to time, quality, and cost. Companies that approach the work thoughtfully and with an appropriate sense of urgency will reap the benefits of expanding into an exciting new market.",https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/industrials-and-electronics/our-insights/unlocking-the-growth-opportunity-in-battery-manufacturing-equipment
Biden-Harris Administration Announces $3.5 Billion to Strengthen Domestic Battery Manufacturing,,"WASHINGTON, D.C. — Today, two years after President Biden signed the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) announced up to $3.5 billion from the Infrastructure Law to boost domestic production of advanced batteries and battery materials nationwide. As part of President Biden’s Investing in America agenda, the funding will create new, retrofitted, and expanded domestic facilities for battery-grade processed critical minerals, battery precursor materials, battery components, and cell and pack manufacturing, all of which are critical to supporting clean energy industries of the future, such as renewable energy and electric vehicles. This investment, which includes a focus on retaining and creating good-paying union jobs in the manufacturing workforce, is administered by DOE’s Office of Manufacturing and Energy Supply Chains (MESC). It supports the Biden-Harris Administration’s efforts to reach a net-zero emissions economy by 2050, for electric vehicles to make up half of all new light-duty vehicle sales by 2030, and to build a domestic supply chain.

“Positioning the United States front and center to meet the growing demand for advanced batteries is how we boost our global competitiveness, maintain and create good-paying jobs, and strengthen our clean energy economy” said U.S. Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm. “President Biden’s historic investments are giving the boost needed to build a robust domestic battery supply chain that is Made-in-America.”

Batteries are a critical part of the transition to a clean energy economy. This transition is lowering energy costs to American families and businesses and reducing harmful greenhouse gas emissions. Batteries are also critical to national competitiveness–for grid storage, for the resilience of homes and businesses, and for electrification of the transportation sector. With the demand for electric vehicles (EVs) and stationary storage alone projected to increase the size of the lithium battery market by five- to ten-fold by the end of the decade, it is essential that the United States invests in the capacity to accelerate the development of a resilient supply chain for high-capacity batteries, including non-lithium batteries.

This funding opportunity is the second phase of $6 billion in total provided by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. In the first phase, DOE awarded fifteen projects that are catalyzing over $5.8 billion in public/private investment. This second phase will boost domestic battery manufacturing and supply chains to effectively support the clean energy transition including by:

Ensuring that the United States has a competitive battery materials processing industry to supply the North American battery supply chain.

Expanding the capabilities of the United States in advanced battery manufacturing.

Enhancing national security by reducing the reliance of the United States on critical minerals, battery materials, components, and technologies from foreign entities of concern.

Advancing the domestic processing capacity of minerals necessary for battery materials and advanced batteries.

Support the goal that 40% of the overall benefits of certain federal investments flow to underserved and overburdened communities (in accordance with the Justice40 Initiative).

Provide workforce opportunities to low- and moderate-income communities.

This second phase prioritizes delivering strong benefits for American workers. The funding opportunity will promote collective bargaining agreements and/or projects that create a high-quality, high-wage hourly production workforce through the community benefits plans.

In this funding opportunity, DOE is prioritizing next-generation technologies and battery chemistries, in addition to lithium-based technologies. Other new focus areas include precursor production and manufacturing for specialized, non-light duty markets. DOE is also calling for projects that will increase separation of battery-grade critical materials, expand production facilities for cathode and anode materials production, and expand battery component manufacturing facilities (i.e., projects that will attract further investment into topic areas solicited in the program’s first phase).

The topic areas of focus for future iterations of this program will be updated approximately every six months to account for market and technology evolution, and investment selections will be made in consecutive rounds.

Concept papers, which are required, are due January 9, 2024. Full applications are due March 19, 2024.

Biden-Harris Administration Awards $2.8 Billion to Supercharge U.S. Manufacturing of Batteries for Electric Vehicles and Electric Grid,,"WASHINGTON, D.C. — The Biden-Harris Administration, through the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), today announced the first set of projects funded by the President’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to expand domestic manufacturing of batteries for electric vehicles (EVs) and the electrical grid and for materials and components currently imported from other countries. The 20 companies will receive a combined $2.8 billion to build and expand commercial-scale facilities in 12 states to extract and process lithium, graphite and other battery materials, manufacture components, and demonstrate new approaches, including manufacturing components from recycled materials. The Federal investment will be matched by recipients to leverage a total of more than $9 billion to boost American production of clean energy technology, create good-paying jobs, and support President Biden’s national goals for electric vehicles to make up half of all new vehicle sales by 2030 and to transition to a net-zero emissions economy by 2050.

“This is truly a remarkable time for manufacturing in America, as President Biden’s Agenda and historic investments supercharge the private sector to ensure our clean energy future is American-made,” said U.S. Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm. “Producing advanced batteries and components here at home will accelerate the transition away from fossil fuels to meet the strong demand for electric vehicles, creating more good-paying jobs across the country.”

Although plug-in EV sales have tripled since President Biden took office, the U.S. depends on foreign sources for many of the processed versions of critical minerals needed to produce EV batteries. Since coming into office, the Biden-Harris Administration has taken swift action to secure a reliable and sustainable battery supply chain. Today’s grants are a critical next step in that strategy. The funded projects announced today include U.S. processing and recycling of critical minerals to support domestic manufacturing. Responsible and sustainable domestic sourcing of the critical materials used to make lithium-ion batteries—such as lithium, cobalt, nickel, and graphite—will strengthen the American supply chain, accelerate battery production to meet increased demand, and secure the nation’s economic competitiveness, energy independence, and national security.

The funding for the selected projects will support:

Developing enough battery-grade lithium to supply approximately 2 million EVs annually

Developing enough battery-grade graphite to supply approximately 1.2 million EVs annually

Producing enough battery-grade nickel to supply approximately 400,000 EVs annually

Installing the first large-scale, commercial lithium electrolyte salt (LiPF6) production facility in the United States

Developing an electrode binder facility capable of supplying 45% of the anticipated domestic demand for binders for EV batteries in 2030

Creating the first commercial scale domestic silicon oxide production facilities to supply anode materials for an estimated 600,000 EV batteries annually

Installing the first lithium iron phosphate cathode facility in the United States

Currently, virtually all lithium, graphite, battery-grade nickel, electrolyte salt, electrode binder, and iron phosphate cathode material are produced abroad, and China controls the supply chains for many of these key inputs.

FACTSHEET: Individual project information can be found here.

Workforce and Community Engagement

DOE evaluated applications on technical merits and contributions to increasing American production of advanced battery components, as well as on applicants’ commitments to deliver benefits for communities and workers. The companies submitted plans for engagement with local stakeholders, Tribal nations, environmental groups, and labor unions to ensure the funded projects create high-quality jobs; advance diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility; and contribute meaningfully to the Justice40 initiative to provide 40% of the overall benefits of federal clean energy investments to disadvantaged and underrepresented communities.

Of the 20 companies selected, five will build new facilities in disadvantaged communities, and 15 in locations adjacent to disadvantaged communities. Additionally, six announced projects have established goals for hiring residents of disadvantaged communities into permanent roles, and 13 included commitments to negotiate Workforce and Community Agreements. These agreements are focused on engagement with host communities, labor unions, and/or Tribal entities, to agree on community benefits and implementation plans. At least two funded projects have collective bargaining agreements for both construction and ongoing production jobs, and an additional nine projects have committed to labor neutrality, with two applicants already pursuing Project Labor Agreements with unions representing their workers.

The funded projects will help employ workers from many different construction and industrial unions and 15 of the projects will collaborate with minority serving institutions, including Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) to hire and train workers. The new and expanded facilities funded through these awards are expected to cumulatively support more than 8,000 jobs, including 5,000 permanent jobs.

The funding announced today is the first phase of $7 billion in total provided by the President’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to strengthen the domestic battery supply chain by supporting upstream materials processing to create the precursor materials for batteries. DOE anticipates moving quickly on additional funding opportunities to continue to fill gaps in and strengthen the domestic battery supply chain.

DOE’s Office of Manufacturing and Energy Supply Chains (MESC) is responsible for strengthening and securing manufacturing and energy supply chains needed to modernize the nation’s energy infrastructure and support a clean and equitable energy transition. MESC will manage the portfolio of projects with support from DOE’s Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy’s Vehicle Technologies Office.

American Battery Material Initiative

The President also announced the launch of the American Battery Material Initiative, a dedicated effort to align Federal investments and activities, domestic and international, to accelerate the development of the full end-to-end battery supply chain, including the critical minerals and materials we need to meet production and deployment goals. The Initiative will be led by DOE, with support from the Department of the Interior, and work closely with the Partnership on Global Infrastructure and Investment and the Department of State to align and leverage dozens of programs and efforts across the Federal government to support and grow the battery supply chain, including resources through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and Inflation Reduction Act. The Initiative will coordinate domestic and international efforts to accelerate permitting for critical minerals projects, ensuring that the United States develops the resources the country needs in an efficient and timely manner, while strengthening Tribal consultation, community engagement, and environmental standards to build smarter, faster, and fairer.",https://www.energy.gov/articles/biden-harris-administration-awards-28-billion-supercharge-us-manufacturing-batteries
LG Will Spend $5.5 Billion on a Battery Factory in Arizona,2023-03-24 00:00:00,"A South Korean battery manufacturer said it would quadruple its planned investment in a new factory in Arizona to meet growing demand from automakers that are trying to ramp up production of electric cars and trucks.

The company, LG Energy Solution, said it would invest $5.5 billion to build the complex near Phoenix, where it plans to make batteries for electric vehicles in 2025 and for energy storage systems the next year.

LG said its decision was driven in part by the Inflation Reduction Act, which became law in August and included federal incentives for the sale and production of electric vehicles and batteries in the United States. Customers of LG, which is one of the world’s largest makers of batteries for electric cars and energy storage devices, include General Motors, Ford Motor, Honda and Tesla.

DETROIT – Ford Motor and battery supplier SK Innovation plan to invest more than $11.4 billion in new U.S. facilities that will create nearly 11,000 jobs to produce electric vehicles and batteries. Ford is building twin lithium-ion battery plants in central Kentucky through a joint venture with South Korea-based SK called BlueOvalSK as well as a massive 3,600-acre campus in west Tennessee, the automaker said Monday night. The campus will include another a battery plant built with SK along with a supplier park, recycling center and a new assembly plant for electric F-Series trucks, Ford CEO Jim Farley told CNBC. The plans are the latest of Ford's to increase development and production of electric vehicles — including batteries — under Farley, who began leading the automaker a year ago this week. They also bolster President Joe Biden's call for companies to onshore supply chains amid a global shortage of semiconductor chips that has disrupted several industries, including automotive.

The investment is part of Farley's ""Ford+"" turnaround plan to make the automaker's traditional operations more profitable and better position it for emerging sectors such as autonomous, electric and connected vehicles. ""This is the new Ford,"" Farley told CNBC during a phone interview. ""It's time. We are putting shovels in the ground, 11,000 new workers. … It's an enormous commitment to build these digital products."" Ford does not expect to take on any additional debt to fund the plans, according to Farley. He said moves will be funded through the company's profits.

The new investment comes on top of the $30 billion the company previously said would go to electric vehicles through 2025, about $7 billion of which had already been invested before February. Production at the plants, aside from one of the battery plants in Kentucky, is expected to begin in 2025, the company said. The second battery plant in Kentucky is expected to come online in 2026, according to Ford.

The ""new Ford"" is a drastic pivot from Farley's predecessor, Jim Hackett, who previously said the automaker saw ""no advantage"" in producing its own battery cells. It comes as Ford's crosstown rival General Motors spends $4.6 billion through a joint venture with LG Chem for battery production, starting in 2023. Farley said the investment should be further proof that Ford, which many on Wall Street believed was behind on EVs, is positioned to be a leader in the segment. ""I don't know of any other company making this announcement. Why would you ever think we're behind? We're ahead,"" Farley said. Shares of Ford have more than doubled since Farley became CEO of the automaker almost a year ago. About $5.6 billion of Ford's investment with SK will go to a new campus called Blue Oval City in Stanton, Tennessee and $5.8 billion for the two factories in Glendale, Kentucky. Ford will cover about $7 billion of the $11.4 billion, according to Lisa Drake, Ford's North America chief operating officer.

""This is a really pivotal moment for us and our country today,"" Drake told reporters during a call. ""We are announcing the largest single investment in new manufacturing facilities in the 118-year history of Ford."" The three new plants for BlueOvalSK will enable 129 gigawatt hours a year of U.S. production capacity for Ford — enough to power 1 million electric vehicles annually, Ford icials said. That's more than half of the EV production capacity Ford expected to have globally by 2030. ""This is truly a staggering project, and one that speaks to Ford's ambition to the fast-growing U.S. EV industry,"" SK Innovation global head of marketing Yoosuk Kim said during a call.

New F-Series coming

Ford expects the new vehicle manufacturing facility in Tennessee to be carbon neutral once fully operational, including zero-waste-to-landfill processes. Farley said the plant will build new electric F-Series pickups. He added the next-generation pickups will be solely designed to be EVs, unlike the upcoming F-150 Lightning that is based off the traditional pickup with an internal combustion engine.

Ford has started initial pre-production of its electric F-150 Lightning pickup truck at a new plant in Dearborn, Mich. Michael Wayland | CNBC

""We're going to build an all-electric bottom up, optimized product platform in this plant. It will be the largest plant in the history of our company,"" Farley said. ""We're going to build lots of fantastic F-Series electric vehicles there. We're not going to be specific about what type."" Farley said the company is ""reinventing what a pickup truck would be,"" including the range, with this announcement. Drake said Ford expects one-third of full-size pickups sold in the U.S. to be fully electric by 2030. Ford's current F-Series lineup includes the F-150 and larger versions of the full-size truck as well as medium-duty trucks and chassis cabs meant for commercial buyers.

Farley and Drake compared the significance of the new EV plants to company founder Henry Ford's mass production of the Model T, which made vehicles more affordable and accessible to the general public. Ford previously said it expected at least 40% of its sales globally to be electric vehicles by the end of this decade. The target was announced prior to the Biden administration setting a target last month for half of all new auto sales to be electric vehicles, including plug-in hybrid models, by 2030 In addition to the manufacturing facilities, Ford said it plan to invest $525 million over the next five years, including $90 million in a pilot program in Texas, for training skilled technicians to service EVs. ""This is just the beginning of our aspirations to lead America in the next century of sustainable transportation economy,"" Drake said. ""This investment is catapulting us ahead to lead the electric revolution.""",https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/27/ford-battery-supplier-to-spend-11point4-billion-to-build-new-us-plants.html
$28 Billion In New Clean Energy Manufacturing Investments Announced Since Inflation Reduction Act Passed,2022-10-12 00:00:00,"The Inflation Reduction Act is the most important climate legislation in United States history, but will it actually generate private investment in new manufacturing?

In a word, absolutely.

Roughly $28 billion in new manufacturing investment has been announced in the weeks following the IRA’s signing. These investments have primarily happened in the electric vehicle, battery, and solar manufacturing sectors – but the trend is just getting started.

The economic upside is massive. Energy Innovation modeling projects the IRA will increase GDP nearly 1% in 2030, and the Blue Green Alliance predicts it could add 9 million jobs in the next ten years. But securing the IRA’s full economic development potential hinges upon state and utility implementation.

The legislation could become America’s most significant investment in clean manufacturing and build a 21st century economy by leveraging tax dollars to generate roughly $1.7 trillion in new investment within a decade, according to Credit Suisse.

Solar investments shining bright

The IRA’s clean energy tax credits completely change the economics of electricity generation in the U.S., using long-term policy to efficiently leverage government funds to accelerate renewable energy and battery storage deployment for utilities and corporations.

Renewable energy manufacturing investments are just starting, but the first announcements are a harbinger of things to come. Woods Mackenzie forecasts renewable energy investments will total $1.2 trillion by 2035, substantially more than without the IRA, and solar energy investment will be two-thirds higher because of the law. Two of the largest U.S. solar manufacturers have already increased their investments.

FirstSolar announced it will spend $1.2 billion to build a new solar panel manufacturing plant, its fourth in the U.S., and expand three existing Ohio plants. The manufacturing investments will create nearly 1,000 new jobs. “In passing the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, Congress and the Biden-Harris Administration has entrusted our industry with the responsibility of enabling America’s clean energy future and we must meet the moment in a manner that is both timely and sustainable,” said FirstSolar CEO Mark Widmar.” We continue to evaluate further investments in incremental capacity and could announce further expansion plans in the future.”

And in the Southeast U.S., REC Silicon announced an agreement with Mississippi Solar to develop a low-carbon U.S.-based solar supply chain from raw materials to fully assembled modules, noting “passage of the Inflation Reduction Act which includes SEMA (Solar Energy Manufacturing for America) legislation will drive increases in the U.S. production of polysilicon and metallurgical grade silicon.”

U.S. clean energy factor expansion since IRA John Smillie

Electric vehicle manufacturers accelerate investments

While almost every U.S. automaker has announced EV model expansions, the future of consumer uptake was uncertain due to several popular EV automakers reaching the 200,000-vehicle cap on federal EV tax credit eligibility, with several more expected to reach that point as soon as 2023.

Even though most EVs are cheaper than internal combustion engines on a monthly basis from the day they’re purchased, those economics depend upon the federal EV tax credit, and without them consumers may not choose to drive electric over fossil fuels. The IRA removes that roadblock by extending the credit for ten years and lifting the manufacturer cap.

While the IRS incentives are expected to modestly increase passenger EV sales, adding the new commercial EV incentives could have a powerful impact on that portion of the market. Automakers are already responding.

GM will invest $760 million at its existing Toledo Propulsion Systems plant to expand manufacturing to make drive units for planned EV models – the automaker’s first U.S. EV-only powertrain or propulsion facility. It also recently said it will invest $491 million at an existing Indiana stamping plant to make various parts for future vehicles.

Foreign automakers are also focusing on the U.S. Kia announced it will shift some of its EV assembly to the U.S. by 2024 to qualify for IRA incentives. Kia currently holds the second largest market share for U.S. EVs, but only manufactures them in South Korea.

EV investments are also expanding beyond just cars and trucks. ABB ABB announced it will build a new EV charger manufacturing facility in South Carolina, capable of building up to 10,000 chargers per year targeting electric school bus and fleet charging, and creating more than 100 jobs.

Battery manufacturers supercharge their U.S. facilities

But even with new EVs made in America, powering those vehicles on the road is another issue. Battery manufacturing and the associated supply chain is largely concentrated in other countries. Designing incentives to gradually require more and more domestic content alongside the IRA’s battery production tax credit will accelerate investments from domestic and international sources eager to power EVs in the world’s second largest auto market.

North American battery manufacturing capacity BloombergNEF/Evelina Stoikou

Battery manufacturing investment announcements have quickly surged ahead. Honda and LG Energy Solutions announced a joint venture to build a $4.4 billion battery factory in Ohio where Honda’s main U.S. factory is located, aiming for 40 gigawatt-hours annual production capacity – enough to power more than 700,000 vehicles according to the companies. LG’s joint venture with Honda is part of its roughly $10 billion investment plan to open four new battery manufacturing plants in North America by 2025 to capture IRA-fueled consumer demand for EVs.

Panasonic, which supplies batteries to Tesla, is in discussions to build a new $4 billion battery plant in the U.S., potentially in Oklahoma. Panasonic already jointly operates a battery factor in Nevada with Tesla, and the new plant is being described as a “twin” plant with another $4 billion EV battery factory Panasonic announced in July for Kansas which could create up to 4,000 direct jobs.

Toyota announced it will more than double a planned EV battery plant in North Carolina, adding $2.5 billion in new investment to a previously announced $1.3 billion plant construction project. The larger plant, which will total $3.8 billion in investment, will create 2,100 new jobs.

Michigan will be home to two new battery manufacturing plants. Local startup Our Next Energy is planning a $1.6 billion cell manufacturing facility that will eventually employ 2,100 people. And Gotion Inc, the U.S. subsidiary of Chinese EV battery manufacturer Guoxuan High-Tech Co., is planning to develop a $3.6 billion manufacturing plant in the state which will create 2,000 new jobs. That’s notable since Chinese companies control most of the world’s battery manufacturing.

U.S.-based companies are also expanding. Mining company Piedmont Lithium announced a $600 million lithium processing and manufacturing plant for EV batteries, citing a need to reduce U.S. dependence on Chinese suppliers, creating 120 new jobs, and crediting recent legislation incentivizing the use of domestically sourced critical materials and providing tax credits for U.S. producers.

EV battery recycler Cirba Solutions announced a $200 million expansion of its existing Ohio facility and a new battery recycling facility in Arizona which will create 185 jobs, both part of the company’s plan to expand battery recycling 600%.

And not to be overlooked, Germany-based Bosch announced it will invest $200 million to expand existing South Carolina facilities to produce hydrogen fuel cell stacks to power electric heavy-duty vehicles, creating at least 350 new jobs along the way.

IRA investments a starting gun in a race to the top

While the true economic impact of the IRA won’t be known for years, or even decades, the early returns are impressive to say the least.

In the words of Credit Suisse analysts, the IRA “definitively changes the narrative from risk mitigation to opportunity capture” for corporations.

$28 billion in new investment, in just a few weeks, could be the starting gun in a race to the top for corporations seeking to capture the massive market for clean energy technologies created by the IRA’s down payment.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/energyinnovation/2022/10/12/roughly-28-billion-in-new-clean-energy-manufacturing-investments-announced-since-inflation-reduction-act-passed/
