The Italy of the batteries beats a blow: 417 mln € for Teverola,2022-03-10 09:44:00+00:00,"The Mise unlocks the first tranche of financing for Fib worth almost 506 million euro. There will also be recycling in the Caserta area. While waiting for the agreement for the Stellantis Gigafactory in Termoli to be put in black and white, the government has struck another blow for batteries in Italy. The move comes from the Ministry of Economic Development (Mise), which issued the decree granting the first tranche of funding to the company Fib, a subsidiary of Seri Industrial. The funds are intended for the Teverola 2 plant, which will be built in the province of Caserta on a total area of 265,000 square metres, 82,000 of which will be covered. Today's is the first EUR 417 million of the total investment, which amounts to almost EUR 506 million. The integration of the treasury will make its appearance in the coming years. Up to 8 GWh According to Fib's plans, the plant should be fully operational in the first half of 2024 and have a production capacity of 7.5-8 GWh of lithium-ion batteries for both the renewable and automotive sectors. As far as four-wheelers are concerned, Teverola 2 will focus mainly on commercial vehicles, electric buses and public transport in general. But that is not all. Inside the factory there will also be a line for recycling end-of-life accumulators. The plan is to recover around 50 tonnes per day of batteries that have reached the end of their first cycle. From Teverola to Termoli The Gigafactory will join Teverola 1, another FIB factory with a production capacity of 350 MWh. The project in Caserta is part of the so-called Ipcei (Important projects of common European interest). And then, when all the signatures are in place, Italy will also have the long-awaited Stellantis plant in Termoli.

Stellantis considers battery factory in Italy,2021-06-02 00:00:00,"Stellantis is apparently considering building a new battery factory in Italy. According to a media report, there have allegedly already been initial talks with the authorities about prerequisites and potential subsidies.

++ This article has been updated. Kindly continue reading below. ++

So far, there have been initial talks with the Italian government about the basic conditions for battery production in the country and possible government subsidies. This information was provided by unnamed sources familiar with the matter, however.

However, the anonymous source stated that nothing had been decided yet. “Discussions are just at the stage of an exchange on the principle of creating a gigafactory in order to cover (Stellantis’) future needs,” he said. “These conditions will have to be studied with Italian authorities.”

Stellantis would not comment on the information to reporters. There has also been no comment from the government. According to Reuters, there was already a virtual meeting last week between Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares, Chairman John Elkann and Italian Industry Minister Giancarlo Giorgetti.

Following the merger of PSA and Fiat-Chrysler to form Stellantis, Italy is one of the group’s most important production locations, where vehicles of numerous group brands are built. According to the Reuters source, because of this production alone, there is a shared interest between the government and Stellantis management “to discuss the terms of a Gigafactory in Italy”.

In April, Stellantis had provided an update on the battery cell factories already planned in Douvrin in northern France and at the Opel site in Kaiserslautern, which are scheduled to start production in late 2023 and late 2025 respectively, and announced that it would decide on further battery factories in Europe and North America this year.

Stellantis plans to offer electric versions for almost all model series in Europe by 2025. By 2030, fully electric cars and hybrids are expected to account for 70 per cent of sales on the continent.

It would not be the first battery project in Italy: in February, the company Italvolt (as an offshoot of Britishvolt) had announced its intention to set up a 45-GWh cell production plant in Italy. Specifically, the plant is to be built in the municipality of Scarmagno near Turin.

Update 11 June 2021: The Italian government has earmarked 600 million euros of public money from the EU reconstruction fund for the factory, which is to have a capacity of 37 GWh and create 500 new jobs by 2030. With further investments from industrial and financial partners, total investments of more than one billion euros are planned, with Stellantis “playing a leading role”.

Stellantis’ top management has met with the Minister for Energy Transition, Roberto Cingolani, five times in recent months, writes Reuters, citing a ministry source. Managers of ACC – the joint venture that the then PSA group had concluded with Total (today: TotalEnergies) to build two battery factories in France and Kaiserslautern – are also said to have been present.

According to sources close to the government, the plan is a public-private partnership, abbreviated as PPP in English. However, one of the people also indicated that other models are being considered. The plan for the battery factory, however, needs a green light from Brussels to ensure that it is compatible with EU competition and state aid rules.

Italy is not yet sure of approval from Brussels. Spain, which is trying to revive its economy shaken by the Corona pandemic, is also seeking major battery projects and subsidies – something not only King Felipe but also VW and its subsidiary Seat have lobbied hard for. “There is a lot of competition … we have to offer a strong strategy and a credible team,” said a source close to the Italian energy transition ministry.

"Lithium cells, modules and batteries",2022-08-01,"FIB is strongly supporting the development of a production process using so-called 'water-based' preparations, without the use of organic solvents.

This process reduces atmospheric emissions into the environment due to both the lower energy consumption of the plant resulting from the absence of a chemical solvent recovery system (the aqueous solution is recycled and reintroduced into the production cycle) and the lower temperature present in some processes. In addition, the use of water instead of solvents allows greater security and flexibility in the future recycling process of the battery, as there is no need to treat the solvent at the end of its life.

In addition to producing cells and modules with fully automated processes, FIB also manufactures complete battery packs.

With its vertical production, FIB also includes in the process the design, customisation and realisation of the Battery Management System (BMS), for battery management and safety and ensuring a high versatility of the final product. Our approach to the market is to integrate complete systems, starting with the production of the cell up to the realisation of the battery pack.

FIB, through the development of the Teverola 2 project, will also set up a pilot line for the recovery of end-of-life lithium-ion batteries, with the aim of recovering the metals contained in the active material, in full compliance with the cardinal principles of the Circular Economy and Green Economy, and taking full advantage of the know-how on waste recovery processes.

Repeating what we have already done for lead-acid batteries, we will produce all the components of lithium accumulators, controlling the entire production chain: anode and cathode assembly cell formation, module assembly and lithium accumulators, also producing in-house the electronics for the BMS (Battery Management System), which makes possible the management and control of the accumulator and communication with any connected equipment.

In 2017, the company chose to focus on LFP (lithium-iron-phosphate) chemistry, instead of NMC (nickel-cobalt-manganese) or NMC-high nickel (with reduced cobalt levels) chemistry.

A strategic choice that, in our opinion, combines safety with high performance and sustainability of the materials used.",https://faam.com/en/teverola-1-and-teverola-2/
"Gigafactory, like Italy and Europe trot with batteries",2021-04-17 00:00:00,"Two in Italy, 70 throughout Europe: here are the gigafactories that will emerge in a few years

In Italy, two gigafactories are envisaged for electric batteries, one in the former Olivetti site in Ivrea and the other in the former Indesit headquarters in Teverola, near Caserta. In Europe by the end of the decade there should be about seventy, according to European Commissioner Maroš Šefčovič.

The Ivrea plant was announced on 18 February, then presented on 4 March in Ivrea, at Confindustria Canavese, and in Châtillon, in Valle d'Aosta, on 9 April. It provides for an annual production capacity of batteries of 45 GWh, with the possibility of increasing to 70 GWh, an investment of 4 billion and 4 thousand jobs. The upcoming completion of the business plan was confirmed in Châtillon, the transfer of the company's registered office, currently in Milan, to Piedmont, the start of the permit applications and the design, with works that should begin in 2022, with production capacity since 2024. The local press and La Stampa of Turin keep the initiative under surveillance for fear that it will have little solidity: in the meantime, discussions have been started with Comau for the plants, with Pininfarina Architettura for the structure of the plant and with the ownership of the land that hosted Olivetti, now managed by Prelios, formerly Pirelli Real Estate.

The Teverola (Caserta) project is more advanced. It relies on a company already operating in the battery sector, FAAM, acquired by Seri Industrial in 2013, which in 2017 bought the former Indesit site (closed in 2017), between Naples and Caserta, from Whirpool. From an investment of 60 million, it is producing customized lithium batteries for 300MWh / year, in lithium-iron-phosphate (LifePo4), relying on Lithops in Orbassano (Turin), acquired in 2015, for research and innovation. 2021 is the transition to the gigafactory, with an initial capacity of 7-8 GWh / year expected to be fully operational in 2023-2024. It has a loan of 505 million euros that comes from the 2.9 billion of the European Commission allocated for the battery sector with the second “ Important Project of Common European Interest ” (IPCEI), one of the operations on the so-called “strategic autonomy”. Compared to Italvolt – which seems to be rather on paper – FAAM is operational and already embedded in the European system of the European Battery Alliance, the corresponding supply chains and automotive companies.

On the other hand, on March 15, Herbert Diess, CEO of Volkwagen, planned 6 gigafactories for a total of 240 GWh / year of batteries to support the electrification of the group's cars, for a mix of sales of zero-emission cars. 70% by 2030 (and not 35% as we said). For Volkswagen and BMW, in addition to the Swedish plant in Skellefteå, of 40 GWh / year mentioned by StartMag and financed by the EIB for 350 million euros, Northvolt is planning a second gigafactory, also of 40 GWh / year, in Salzgitter, around 70 km southeast of Hannover.

On the sidelines of the ministerial meeting of the EU Alliance for batteries, on 11 March, the European Commissioner Maroš Šefčovič had mentioned in all the 27 member countries as many as 70 projects similar to that of Ivrea, Teverola, Skellefteå, Berlin (with Tesla) and Salzgitter.The European strategy dates back to 2019 , a proposal for a regulation was adopted on 10 December and is currently in consultation. The demand for batteries is expected to be high in the European Union, up to 565 GWh by 2030, on the 3600 GWh global.

If you look at the European map released by Jochen Mähliß ( here the link ), of the Bavarian VDE Renewables, the idea of ​​this multitude of gigafactories becomes clearer. There are projects still in the phase of simple conception, such as ItalVolt in Ivrea or Verkor in Grenoble, or well supported, such as ACC (Automotive Cell Company) in Douvrin and Billy-Berclau in the parts of Calais, in northern France, and in Kaiserlautern, in Germany.

ACC is designing a production of up to 48 Gwh / year from 2023 for 5 billion investments, owned by Saft (batteries, bought by Total in 2016 for 1 billion euros) and Stellantis, which therefore involves PSA / Opel (which explains the Kaiserslautern settlement) and FCA from afar.

The ministers of economic development Giancarlo Giorgetti and Bruno Le Maire mentioned gigafactory during the Italian-French meeting on March 19 last . However, the two countries are still a good step behind German activism, France perhaps attentive or distracted by the hydrogen supply chain, Italy perhaps intent on positioning itself, given the apparent weakness of the Scarmagno project.

Eight factories are planned in Germany and another four will be in Slovakia, including InoBat in Bratislava. In the Battery and Systems segment, just 5 Italian partners are part of the European Battery Alliance: Comau, Faam, Green Energy Storage, the Italian Institute of Technology in Genoa (IIT) and the Politecnico di Milano.

In the same segment, there are 13 subjects for France, 34 for Germany.
