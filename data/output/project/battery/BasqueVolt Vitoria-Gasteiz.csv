Iberdrola takes a stake in Basquevolt, the solid-state battery company

Basquevolt, the Basque solid-state battery initiative, will begin production of battery cells in 2027 with the aim of reaching 10GWh capacity, after its creation was signed today. This is one of the main objectives set out in Basquevolt's articles of association, which include as founding shareholders the Basque Government, through the venture capital fund Ezten, Iberdrola, CIE Automotive, Enagás, EIT InnoEnergy and CIC energiGUNE.

After two years of intense work and maximum discretion, Basquevolt is now a reality that will make the Basque Country a European benchmark in the development of solid-state batteries.

The experience of the companies that make up the initial group of investors ensures that Basquevolt is in a very important competitive position both in the battery race, where there are also important opportunities for collaboration, and in the storage industry, which is key to making progress in the energy transition.

Basquevolt begins its journey of starting up the first production line within 4 years, supported by an investment of more than 700 million euros, and which will be able to generate more than 800 direct jobs.

The first phase of Basquevolt will be based at the Alava Technology Park, in the Marie Curie Building (Albert Einstein, 35), located just a few metres from CIC energiGUNE. The centre, which will offer Basquevolt its technological support, based on more than 10 years of research work in the field of solid-state batteries, has a team of researchers led by Michel Armand - ""father"" of the polymeric solid electrolyte-. In this sense, Basquevolt's technology is based on the use of a composite electrolyte patented by the Basque centre.

The promoters of Basquevolt are aware that liquid electrolyte lithium batteries are reaching maturity and that the next technological breakthrough to truly unlock the true potential of energy storage must come from the solid state. The company's initial targets are the development of prototype cells and a pilot production line in 2025, with the ambition to start production in 2027.

Solid-state battery technology is the only battery technology that meets the most demanding requirements of the automotive sector in terms of performance, which is why it is becoming the strategic focus of the automotive industry. The advantage of solid-state batteries over liquid batteries is that they allow better efficiency, longer life and less wear and tear when recharging. Thanks to its technology base, Basquevolt aims to become the European leader in solid-state batteries.

Specifically, Basquevolt aims to develop - in a sustainable way - the best materials and battery cells to enable the mass deployment of electric transport, stationary energy storage - including hybridisation with hydrogen-gas systems - and advanced portable devices.

"Basquevolt, the Basque initiative to make solid-state batteries",2022-08-31 00:00:00,"This news about Basquevolt came out in June, but as we often say, we just don’t have time for everything. Nevertheless, given how important and interesting this news is, we had to share it.

The Basquevolt project, which expects an investment of €700 million, got started two years ago in secret, and its main goal is setting up a production line to make solid-state batteries by 2027. The production capacity will be 10 GWh a year, similar to large projects of a similar nature that are being set up in China), and it’s expected to create 800 new direct jobs.

The consortium of founding investors in the project, led by the Basque Government, includes Iberdrola, CIE Automotive, Enagás, EIT InnoEnergy, and CIC energiGUNE, whose research has facillitated the creation of this initiative.

This Basque research center, CIC energiGUNE, provides Basquevolt with technological support based on more than ten years of research in the field of solid-state batteries. The research team there is led by Michel Armand, the “father” of the polymeric solid electrolyte. Specifically, the technology that will be applied at Basquevolt will be based on the use of an electrolyte compound patented by CIC energiGUNE.

Basquevolt will initially develop technologies that include the patented polymer electrolyte compound and an anode with a high silicon content, which will help solve some of the challenges of solid-state batteries. The technologies to be applied by 10 CIC energiGUNE patents that have been licensed to Basquevolt as part of the launch.

This unique technology raises lithium batteries to a new level, supplying products to the market that have high energy density and are safer and more competitive, all while significantly bringing down the costs of manufacturing batteries with a manufacturing process that is more energy efficient and less expensive.

In sum, the batteries made in the Basque Country will offer greater energy density at a lower cost, which will allow for the manufacture of vehicles with greater range and a lower price. These are the two key elements necessary to guarantee a “comfortable” transition from fossil-fuel vehicles to electric ones.

This project is one of the two large initiatives in the Basque Autonomous Community to occupy a leading positing in the new industry of production and distribution of energy that Europe and the world are developing. The second project is the Basque Hydrogen Corridor.

The Community of Navarre is participating in the Ebro Hydrogen Corridor, along with the communities of Aragaon, Catalonia, and the Basque Country. Battery Packs Nabatt is looking to build an assembly plant for electric car batteries in Navarre, with the public company Sodena, as well as private Basque companies Fagor Ederlan and Ingeteam participating.

We hope to be able to speak about all of these in later entries. For now, we’ll leave you with articles about the public launch of the Basquevolte project.

Basquevolt will evaluate various digitalisation processes related to the production of solid-state lithium batteries, providing the plant with the best technological solutions.

Telefónica and Siemens will provide corporate (IT) and operational (OT) connectivity to Basquevolt´s new battery prototype plant.

This is a pioneering project in Europe in the manufacture of solid-state lithium battery cells, unique in Europe in terms of technology.

Cybersecurity throughout the industrial process is one of the keys to this strategic project, which is key to progress in electric mobility.

Vitoria-Gasteiz, Spain 2 November 2023.- Telefónica and Siemens have joined forces with Basquevolt, a Spanish company that is a pioneer in the manufacture of solid-state battery cells. The aim of the project is to set up a prototyping line integrating various digitalisation processes.

In this strategic project, Basquevolt will rely on Telefónica´s advanced services to provide the transversality required by this prototype-scale manufacturing plant, both in terms of connectivity and equipment, and in terms of professional services and cybersecurity in the IT and OT fields.

This prototyping line will have a robust industrial connectivity network perfectly adjusted to all the communication requirements of the machines both in the production process (LAN OT) and the plant´s operational systems, complying with industrial standards ISA/IEC 62443 and ANSI/ISA-95, using Siemens communication equipment from the Scalance family.

Telefónica and Siemens´ industrial sector specialists and Basquevolt´s technical engineering and modelling team have been working for months on a solution that will host the critical systems that operate Basquevolt´s manufacturing processes reliably and ensure cell production.

Likewise, the adoption of cybersecurity measures in the industrial sphere has been a fundamental point in the design of the plant´s digitalisation solutions. In this regard, through Telefónica Tech, a series of solutions have been implemented to protect the industrial perimeter, segment and restrict unwanted traffic, as well as to detect and respond to threats that may affect the Basque company´s end devices.

The first results of this strategic project are expected in the first four months of 2024.

Industry in transformation

Francisco Carranza, CEO of Basquevolt, highlights: ""The cutting-edge battery technology that will be developed in this prototype plant requires an extremely robust IT/OT network that enables the control and management of devices, processes and infrastructure, ensuring continuous improvement in productivity, quality, efficiency and flexibility of our manufacturing operations"".

Adrián García Nevado, Director of B2B at Telefónica Spain, says: ""This alliance with Basquevolt means for Telefónica to develop its digitalisation strategy of pioneering projects and is part of its policy of supporting companies in their transformation processes as a technological partner of reference"". Thanks to the agreement with Basquevolt, Telefónica, through its various solutions, is positioned in a key sector such as solid-state lithium batteries, with a long history in the field of industry and sustainability.

José Ramón Castro, General Manager of Siemens Digital Industries for Spain and Portugal, emphasises: ""Siemens is committed to a cybersecure digital transformation of Spanish industry. Our goal is to guarantee the maximum robustness of facilities and communications networks to minimise the impact of any possible cyber-attack”.",https://basquevolt.com/en/news/news/telefonica-and-siemens-digitalise-basquevolts-solid-state-battery-cell-prototyping-plant
Basquevolt wants to start producing solid-state batteries by 2025,2022-06-16 00:00:00,"The companies Iberdrola, CIE Automotive, Enagás, EIT InnoEnergy and CIC energiGUNE have launched the Basquevolt initiative with the Basque government to research, develop and produce solid-state batteries.

The plan is to develop prototype cells and commission a pilot production line in 2025 with investments of 700 million euros. An annual production volume of 10 GWh is then to be achieved in 2027.

The location for the first phase of Basquevolt activities will be the Álava Technology Park in Spain. This Basque research centre will provide Basquevolt with technological support rooted in over ten years of research in the field of solid-state batteries. The research centre has a team of researchers led by Michel Armand. A French professor of chemistry, Michel Armand is also a physicist, materials scientist and electrochemist. He has been working at CIC energiGUNE in Spain since 2011. At the end of the 1970s, he came up with the basics of a rechargeable battery in which lithium ions move back and forth between two solid bodies, making him “the intellectual father of modern batteries”. It is therefore hardly surprising that Basquevolt’s technology is based on the use of a composite electrolyte patented by CIC energiGUNE.

Generally, Iberdrola is more focused on the field of charging infrastructure, and has made several high profile partnerships in the recent past to gain the upper hand on the Spanish charging market while vastly expanding its charging infrastructure. Partners include Volkswagen, Volvo, as well as more local players, such as the electric bus manufacturer Irizar, who also wants to see growth in the Spanish charging infrastructure. Last year, there was also talk of building a battery plant in partnership with Volkswagen subsidiary Seat near Barcelona. Seat had already constructed a battery testing lab at the Martorell location near Barcelona in 2020.
