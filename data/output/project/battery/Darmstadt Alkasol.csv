Akasol starts up battery production at new plant in Darmstadt,2021-08-17 00:00:00,"Battery system manufacturer Akasol has officially commissioned its ‘Gigafactory 1’ at its headquarters in Darmstadt, Germany. The production lines currently offer a production capacity of one gigawatt-hour. However, expansion to adjacent areas is already planned with up to 5 GWh per year. Enough for 10,000 electric buses and trucks.

But production at Gigafactory 1 has already been running for a while: Akasol had already moved into the new headquarters in October 2020 and started production – with an initial one GWh. However, a ceremonial opening of the plant did not take place last autumn due to the pandemic-related restrictions.

At the opening ceremony, Hesse’s Minister of Economics Tarek Al-Wazir was among the 160 guests, and Federal Minister of Economics Peter Altmaier gave a video greeting. “With the new Gigafactory in Darmstadt, AKASOL AG is making a decisive contribution to CO2 reduction in public transportation and logistics,” said Altmaier. “Innovative enterprises like this one help us meet our ambitious climate goals – and they create added value and jobs in Germany.”

Akasol CEO Sven Schulz spoke of a “significant milestone in our company history”. According to the company, it has invested 100 million euros at the site. “Here in Darmstadt, we produce high-performance lithium-ion battery modules and systems in a highly automated and extremely advanced production facility, which are an important key in the transport and energy transition,” Schulz said. “The course is now set for us to continue our growth as an innovation driver in electromobility even more dynamically.”

With the addition of new production lines, a capacity of the aforementioned 2.5 GWh should be reached in 2022, with up to five gigawatt-hours possible depending on customer demand. The cells, which Akasol assembles into modules and packs and equips with controllers and cooling systems, come from Samsung SDI, among others. According to Akasol, the plant would be “by far the largest production site for Li-ion battery systems in commercial vehicle applications in Europe” when fully expanded. Battery systems for more than 10,000 commercial vehicles per year could then come from Darmstadt. Akasol traditionally does not name customers, but it is known that the company supplies the Belgian bus manufacturer Van Hool and the Swedish Volvo Group.

The 20,000 square metre Akasol campus is located in the southwest of Darmstadt. In addition to the 15,000 square metre two-storey production, assembly and logistics hall, there is also a test and validation centre for testing cells, modules and systems on the site. The offices of the 7,500 square metre headquarters, right next to the production hall, are home to the up to 350 employees from research and development, sales, product and project management as well as purchasing and administration. The organic food retailer Alnatura also has its headquarters nearby.

“It is important to us to offer our employees in the new headquarters a modern and attractive working environment, one that promotes both knowledge-sharing and personal well-being,” says Carsten Bovenschen, CFO and Chief Human Resources Officer of the company. “Our campus has a sustainable energy supply and a production and test environment built to the highest standards of quality. With this investment, we are laying the cornerstone for our continued growth and long-term business success in the fast-growing market of electromobility.” A 600 kWp solar plant feeds the production facility and offices as well as Hesse’s largest charging station park for electric vehicles with over 60 charging stations with solar power.

The new ultra-high-energy AKASystem AKM CYC battery systems, which were crowned with the Innovation Award 2019 at the 25th Busworld exhibition in Brussels, will be manufactured at this location, Akasol points out. These systems, still quoting Akasol press release, achieve a further improved energy density compared to current systems, enabling the highest ranges of 600-800 kilometers under demanding real conditions in fully electric buses and commercial vehicles, depending on the vehicle type and driving profile.

Akasol in Darmstadt. With Manz AG

For the new Gigafactory 1, Akasol has now commissioned the production equipment manufacturer Manz AG to supply the first fully automated module production lines. Headquartered in Reutlingen, Manz AG has extensive expertise in the field of automated battery, cell and module production equipment, having successfully implemented various projects in the automotive industry in recent years.

“With a total capacity of up to 5 GWh in the new Gigafactory 1 in Darmstadt, Akasol is well positioned to be able to deliver the quantities agreed with our serial customer in the coming years. In addition, the new Gigafactory 1 will be an important basis for the further expansion of our production capacities in North America, where we will install Gigafactory 2 with almost identical production equipment from the beginning of 2022. We are pleased that we could partner with Manz AG, an experienced and leading technology partner in this sector. Manz will supply the first equipment for Gigafactory 1 by the end of this year,” commented Sven Schulz, CEO of AKASOL AG.

Automated production lines for batteries to support dynamic growth

According to Schulz, the successive expansion of fully automated production lines underscores the dynamic growth in the global market of high-performance and efficient battery systems for the electrification of commercial vehicles. “With the new Gigafactory 1, we are creating the best conditions for the supply of our technology-agnostic product portfolio to our customers, thereby strengthening our leading position as the largest manufacturer of lithium-ion battery systems for commercial vehicles in Europe,” Schulz continued.

In addition to the expansion of new production capacities, AKASOL’s investment focus in the next few months will be on the construction of the new headquarters, where a state-of-the-art and environmentally friendly test and validation center as well as a main administration building and space for up to 500 workplaces are being built on the 20,000 square meter site next to Gigafactory 1. Carsten Bovenschen, CFO of AKASOL AG, explained: “By the end of this year, we will be investing around EUR 60 million in the infrastructure of our new corporate headquarters and Gigafactory 1 in Darmstadt. This highlights our strategy to successfully manage the dynamic growth ahead of us as a global player, while additionally laying the foundation for long-term corporate success by winning new potential serial customers.”",https://www.sustainable-bus.com/components/akasols-new-plant-in-darmstadt-will-have-fully-automated-production-lines-by-manz/

Akasol announces further investment to expand battery production,2019-04-01 00:00:00,"Germany – Battery maker, Akasol AG, which opened a new EUR10m headquarters and production facility in Langen during 2018, is now making further investment to build a new and larger facility in Darmstadt. The investment, said to be in the mid double digit millions, is to see the immediate start of construction on a 20,000 square metre site on the former US Kelley Barracks property. This is to become the new headquarters and house another 500 personnel in both administration and production.

Two buildings are to be erected - a four-story main administration building with a gross floor area of 7,000 square metres and an adjoining production, assembly and warehouse area with a gross floor space of 15,000 square metres on two floors - both are to be used for the expansion of series production and for the production of small batches.",https://truckandbusbuilder.com/article/2019/04/01/akasol-announces-further-investment-to-expand-battery-production
Akasol Notes Dynamic Growth Of Demand For EV Batteries In U.S.,2020-08-23,"German battery pack manufacturer Akasol announced a dynamic growth of demand in the U.S., where the company is setting up its first North American production site in Hazel Park, Michigan.

The construction of the facility with an output of 400 MWh annually had begun in H1 2020 and should be operational later this year.

The next step is to expand it to 2 GWh annually by 2023 and a follow-up order for delivery of a fully automated production line was already placed.

2 GWh is quite a substantial amount, an equivalent of 8,000 packs at 250 kWh. As the company is supplying battery packs mostly for commercial vehicles, like buses and trucks (including Mercedes-Benz eCitaro), it suggests that this segment is finally taking off in the U.S.

According to Akasol, the customer is ""a global [undisclosed] commercial-vehicle manufacturer that will outfit its US brands and vehicle types with new, high-energy battery systems by AKASOL beginning in 2021"".

So we will wait and see what new commercial EVs will appear on the market in 2021.

By the way, Akasol's third-generation battery systems (from 2021) will have an energy density of up to 200 Wh/kg.

The expansion of manufacturing capacity takes place also in Germany, where the company expanded plant in Langen to 800 MWh annually and is building a new plant in Darmstadt with a goal for 2 GWh annually by H2 2021.

As Sven Schulz, CEO at AKASOL AG, pointed out:",https://insideevs.com/news/440390/akasol-dynamic-growth-demand-ev-batteries-us/
Akasol orders battery production systems from Woll,2020-04-21 00:00:00,"The battery systems manufacturer Akasol commissioned Woll Maschinenbau from Germany to develop and supply highly automated production systems. From mid 2021, the new battery systems of the type AKASystem AKM CYC will be manufactured in Darmstadt.

The total investment volume for the order is in the low double-digit million euro range and includes the option of further production lines at Akasol’s US site in Hazel Park, Michigan USA, as well as the subsequent expansion of the Darmstadt production facility in Germany that Akasol refers to as its own “Gigafactory 1”.

It was only at the beginning of February that Akasol also commissioned the mechanical engineering company Manz from Reutlingen in Germany to build fully automated production lines. While Manz will provide the equipment to produce battery modules, Woll will supply special machines that link ten of these modules to form a battery system. “Continually increasing the degree of automation in serial production is of high importance in order to allow us to meet our customers’ growing demand for production-ready high-energy battery systems,” says Akasol boss Sven Schulz. “With the new equipment, we will be in a position to build up our production capacity in Gigafactory 1 in Darmstadt to as high as 5 GWh”. This puts the company in a good position to deliver the quantities agreed with current customers within the next few years.

Akasol’s third battery system generation, the AKASystem AKM CYC, is to be produced on the new, 100-metre long production line in Darmstadt from mid-2021. According to the Darmstadt-based company, the battery solutions that weigh around 500 kilograms and store 100 kWh could be produced at a rate of up to 70 units every day. The production line should be flexible enough to be able to build “customer-specific products of the same battery system type”. According to Akasol, a further acceleration of the production is quite possible: with further investments in automation solutions, the cycle time can be reduced to up to 10 minutes per battery system, Schulz says. “As a result, we have the potential to raise output to as high as 126 systems per day, for a storage capacity of 12.5 MWh per day”.

According to the company, Akasol’s ‘Gigafactory 1’ also has sufficient space to install a second line of the same type there. As a result, the production capacity at the Darmstadt site could be expanded by up to 5 GWh per year in the future. Schulz says, “With Gigafactory 1 in Darmstadt, Akasol will have by far the largest commercial vehicle battery system production capacity in Europe”.

The Darmstadt plant also forms the basis for the further expansion of capacity in North America, where Akasol plans to start operating the “Gigafactory 2” with almost identical production equipment from early 2022. At the Langen site in Germany – just north of the company’s headquarters – Akasol had already increased production capacity to up to 800 MWh in March by commissioning a second production line. With the construction of the plant in Darmstadt, the manufacturer is further increasing capacity in view of “follow-up orders from long-standing series customers”. In September 2019, Akasol received a follow-up order from an existing commercial vehicle customer, among others, which is expected to be “in the high three-digit million euro range”. This is likely to be Volvo.
