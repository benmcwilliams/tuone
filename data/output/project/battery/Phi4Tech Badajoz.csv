The project is the private initiative of Phi4tech (battery and cathode factories), Lithium Iberia (Las Navas mining project and lithium transformation factory) and individual partners in the case of the Aguablanca mine. The project has financing, clients and project.

In addition, to these initiatives must be added the decision to locate the National Energy Storage Center in C√°ceres, with which it is intended to collaborate in theoretical and applied research, and the implementation of an engineering postgraduate master‚Äôs degree at the University of Extremadura.

Regarding the lithium mining project in Las Navas, the exploitation project and restoration plan as well as the environmental document that respond to all the determinations contained in the scope document are currently being drafted.

The total estimated investment is about 316 million euros (173 million for the lithium transformation factory plus 143 million for the mine and mining plant) with direct employment of 405 people.

Regarding the Aguablanca mine, it is intended to reopen and extract nickel, gold and cobalt. When it is in full swing, about 350 people will be working in Monesterio.

In short, it is an integrating project that is already starting with a global investment of more than 1,000 million euros and 1,300 directs jobs, which indirect ones will have to be added.

A new time for Extremadura with Phi4tech battery cell factory

The president of the Junta de Extremadura, Guillermo Fern√°ndez Vara, has pointed out that for the Autonomous Community ‚Äúa new time is beginning‚Äù which means joining the industrial revolution of the 21st century and that ‚Äúwe really need it‚Äù.

Fern√°ndez Vara has assured that Extremadura aspires that its future does not depend every six years on how much money will come from European funds or on how it will be in the distribution of regional financing, but rather that it wants an ‚Äúinclusive‚Äù project, a community that it receives from Spain and that it also contributes to the country‚Äôs economy.

For the Extremaduran president there is still a debt with the region ‚Äúand that is that we can fly with our own wings‚Äù and be able to ‚Äúalso compete in the industrial league‚Äù, while he has assured that ‚Äúa new actor arrives‚Äù who is tired of give an image that ‚Äúhas nothing to do with Extremadura today.‚Äù

He has repeated that he is a new actor who arrives with great enthusiasm and with the aim of being ‚Äúmasters of our destiny‚Äù, for which he has resources such as industrial land, sun and water, as well as electrical power to meet the needs that are arriving and of the railway improvements that will allow an exit to the merchandise from the region.

He also stated that in Extremadura ‚Äúwe are not in a permanent electoral campaign‚Äù but working for Extremadura, Spanish people, without fireworks, and wanted to express ‚Äúloudly‚Äù that Extremadura does not renounce anything, while advancing that there will be more projects that will be presented when they become a reality.

The president described the project presented as something ‚Äúloaded with symbolism‚Äù and has had words to remember ‚Äúmany generations‚Äù of businessmen, politicians and citizens who have fought to make this possible, with a special mention for Juan Carlos Rodr√≠guez Ibarra.

Guillermo Fern√°ndez Vara, President of the Junta de Extremadura:

We do not need wings, but that they do not cut them off, and that they treat us in the same conditions as others when making decisions.

On the other hand, he has received recognition from the Government and the Ministry of Industry, without whose participation the project presented would ‚Äúbe impossible‚Äù.

He has also valued the role played by the University of Extremadura, which, he recalled, was born in 1974 and has not only allowed the children of day laborers to obtain degrees, but also a new generation of talented citizens who ‚Äúcapable of taking charge of our future‚Äù.

The Secretary General of Industry and SMEs, Ra√∫l Blanco, has described this presentation as ‚Äúexcellent news for Extremadura and for our country‚Äù, especially at a time ‚Äúso severe‚Äù in the health aspect.

He pointed out that the project began its journey about two years ago and that it is part of the strategy to accelerate the transformation of the automobile sector in Spain, while also underlining its importance as it is an initiative that will generate industrial activity and a quality and stable employment.

More about the battery cell factory

During the presentation, the CEO of Phi4tech, Mario Celdr√°n, offered some details about the Badajoz battery cell factory. The factory will have a planned final capacity of 10 gigawatts, planned modularly over time in 5 modules of 2GW.

El m√≥dulo inicial de 2GW se inaugurar√≠a un a√±o y medio despu√©s de iniciadas las obras, exigir√° una inversi√≥n de unos 80 millones de euros y crear√° 200 empleos directos. Las estimaciones son alcanzar los 6GW de producci√≥n en 2024. Cuando se alcance la capacidad m√°xima (10GW), se habr√°n invertido 400 millones de euros en total y unos 500 empleados directos trabajar√°n en la f√°brica, con opci√≥n de ampliaci√≥n a 20 GWh/a√±o en 2027.

Phi4tech‚Äôs proposal for its plant in Extremadura is to create a next-generation hybrid battery and supercapacitor. The battery / supercapacitor ensures fast charging, high durability and extremely favorable chemistry with the best charge / discharge ratio on the market. It does not contain cobalt, betting on the criteria of sustainability and recyclability aligned with the values promoted by the European Commission.

For the qualification of its employees, Phi4tech is committed to creating an ecosystem of society, university, professional training and administrations, which makes it possible to create value not only economically but also in the training of qualified professionals.

The next step will be to deliver the project plans to the Badajoz City Council to immediately process its urban planning license, and it is estimated that by the end of this year or early 2022 there will already be machines working on the plot, and 20 months later it could be in conditions to inaugurate it, approximately in the middle of 2023.",https://batteryindustry.tech/extremadura-will-host-phi4tech-first-battery-cell-factory-in-southern-europe/
Spain begins to build its first battery factory for electric cars,,"Spain begins constructing its first lithium battery cell factory , and lithium extraction will commence in 2022. This step will minimize reliance on the Asian market and gradually lower the cost of automobiles equipped with lithium batteries.

The electric car presents not only the issue of autonomy and the obstacle of high-speed charging infrastructure but also the high cost of BEV automobiles. This is due to the high cost of lithium-ion batteries and significant investment in new technologies, beginning with the modular platforms on which these new cars are built.

Regarding lithium-ion batteries, which are used by electric cars and most hybrids and plug-in hybrids, even though Spain is a prominent participant in Europe's automotive sector, European manufacturers have an alarming reliance on Asia. This is where most of the lithium extraction industry and the majority of the market for the fabrication of cells for electric vehicle batteries are concentrated, even though some of the batteries are assembled locally.

In Spain, there are automobile plants for Renault, Mercedes-Benz, Nissan, Ford, the Volkswagen Group, and the PSA Group. Spain is a significant vehicle exporter to the whole European market, and our country is producing an increasing number of electric vehicles. However, our industry remains too reliant on Asia to supply battery cells utilized in these new electric cars.

Consider lithium extraction, and its usage in the construction of cells is already costly. In that case, the final price of batteries, and the ultimate price of this sort of automobile, are influenced by the additional transportation expenses. And now that we are in the midst of the so-called semiconductor crisis, it is more evident than ever that the principle of globalization is sound. Still, mismatches exist, and lowering reliance would be beneficial.

The situation as a whole demonstrates why Spain should produce batteries for electric vehicles. Not just for the sake of the whole European car market but also as an essential vehicle production hub for the entire Old Continent. Also, this might minimize reliance, lower costs, and assist the introduction of electric vehicles in Europe.

Many suggestions for lithium extraction in Spain have been made in recent years, but these projects have not materialized for various reasons. However, in 2018, the business Lithium Iberia began investigating the feasibility of harvesting lithium in Extremadura. According to their investigations, there is a vein of interest there, and they have been submitting papers to obtain an exploitation concession since then.

Lithium Iberia hopes to have this exploitation concession accessible during 2022, allowing operations to commence in Spain in 2023. This means that Spain will be operating a lithium mine to supply its battery plant for electric vehicles in less than two years.",https://www.evstories.com/phi4tech/spain-begins-build-its-first-battery-factory-electric-cars

Construction Begins for Spain‚Äôs First Major Production Base for Lithium Battery Cells,2021-08-04 22:00:00,"Various energy news websites have reported that construction started in June for Spain‚Äôs first GW-scale production base for lithium battery cells. The base is located in Noblejas, a municipality in the province of Toledo and within the autonomous region of Castilla-La Mancha. The main developer of this project is Phi4Tech, a company specializing in graphene-related technologies. The base is scheduled to begin pilot production before the end of this year.

This March, Phi4Tech and the regional government of Extremadura jointly announced the plan to establish an integrated industry cluster for lithium batteries. The Noblejas base has the advantage of being in close proximity to the Las Navas mine that contains lithium deposits. In Extremadura, mining company Lithium Iberia will build a refinery for lithium and a production plant for cathode materials. Additionally, there is a proposal to reopen the Aguablanca mine in Extremadura as this mine has deposits of nickel and cobalt. According to reporting by other media outlets, the Las Navas mine will be able to start supplying lithium to nearby battery production plants in 2023.

Capacity building at the Noblejas base will be implemented in multiple phases. Before the end of this year, the production capacity of the base is expected to reach 300MWh. Afterward, it will expand to 2GWh in 2023, 10GWh in 2025, and finally 20GWh in 2027. The construction of the Noblejas base and cathode production facility in Extremadura (i.e., in the province of C√°ceres) will entail a total investment of around ‚Ç¨1 billion. The development of the two projects is also expected to create 1,600 new jobs.

Phi4Tech and Lithium Iberia have also teamed up to build another GW-scale battery production base in Extremadura (i.e., in the province of Badajoz). This base will have a total production capacity of 10GWh and be developed in five phases, with 2GW being added each phase. Phi4Tech estimates that ‚Ç¨400 million will be invested into the construction of the Badajoz base.",https://www.energytrend.com/news/20210804-22812.html
Second large battery factory to be built in Extremadura by Acciona and Envision,2022-06-02 12:55:08+02:00,"Mata MADRIDSpain will have two large battery factories. One will be in Sagunt, under the auspices of Seat and its parent company Volkswagen. The other will be in the Extremadura town of Navalmoral de la Mata. Here, the Spanish company Acciona and the Chinese group Envision will build a battery gigafactory, Extremadura daily Hoy has reported and sources familiar with the project have confirmed to ARA. Spain will thus have two large battery factories.

The Extremadura plant will take up 200 hectares in the municipality of Navalmoral de Mata and will receive a private investment of ‚Ç¨800m. However, the companies hope to obtain public money from the PERTE fund for renewable energies, green hydrogen and energy storage. This fund, endowed with ‚Ç¨6.9bn, depends on the Ministry of Ecological Transition, although the Ministry of Industry, which has been working for some time to attract investors for the manufacture of batteries, will also be part of this specific project.

Unlike the Volkswagen group, which presented its project for Sagunt in the framework of the electric car PERTE fund, the companies Acciona and Envision have chosen the PERTE for renewable energies and green hydrogen, leaving the door open for Acciona to develop renewable energy projects in parallel to the factory. Sources from the Ministry of Ecological Transition explain to ARA that the PERTE for renewables has received up to 100 different projects valued at over than ‚Ç¨800m and that all these projects ""are still being analysed"".

Lithium, an attraction

The Extremadura factory will have a capacity of 10 GW with a possibility to expand, and it will provide direct employment to some 3,000 people, according to Canal Extremadura. For some time now, business insiders have pointed out that the Extremadura government had made a very firm commitment to attract such a project, making it easier for investors, in the hope of putting an end to the region's centuries-long economic backwardness. In fact, the project announced by Phi4tech in March 2021 to build battery cells will also be developed in Extremadura. Sources from the Ministry of Industry already pointed out to ARA that a second plant would have much more power than the one announced by Phi4tech, although it has not been ruled out that the projects could be brought together.

They all have one element in common: they are drawn in by Extremadura's lithium mines. Lithium has gained sudden fame and is attracting attention worldwide, especially from mining industries and multinational automakers, as it is indispensable for the manufacture of electric car batteries. ""Industrial development has to take place next to where the lithium is, and that is why it makes perfect sense for Extremadura to have lithium refining, a gigafactory and industrial elements that connect with the rest [of the region],"" said the Secretary of State for Industry, Ra√ºl Blanco, in an interview with ARA.",https://en.ara.cat/business/second-large-battery-factory-built-extremadura-acciona-envision_1_4390992.html
Commencement of construction work on our supercapacitor factory in Badajoz,2023-05-11 09:00:15+00:00,"On 10 May, clearance work began on our site located at the Plataforma Log√≠stica del Suroeste Europeo (Logistics Platform of Southwest Europe) in Badajoz where our supercapacitor cell manufacturing plant and the nanomaterials research centre for energy storage is to be build.

Once this phase has been completed, the earthworks and foundations for the construction of both buildings will be carried out. Total investment in these two premises is expected to reach ‚Ç¨100 million when all expansion phases are fully developed.

This plant in Badajoz, which will serve the needs of our data centre and renewable energy customers, will produce 600,000 units of energy storage supercapacitors per year and will be operational in early 2025. These supercapacitors will improve the efficiency of renewable energy by up to 15% due to their fast charge and discharge capability.

The research and development centre for nanomaterials for energy storage will be completed by the end of 2024. In the same year, the centre will welcome its first 60 researchers, a number that will double to 120 by 2025, creating around 200 direct jobs in the future.

The supercapacitor factory is part of the Proyecto Integral de Almacenamiento Energ√©tico de Extremadura (Extremadura Integrated Energy Storage Project), which, together with Lithium Iberia, aims to contribute to the country's energy transition and become the spearhead of Extremadura's booming economy.

In addition, the construction of this new factory will strengthen our close collaboration with the University of Extremadura and enable us to enter into new agreements for the postgraduate training of professionals in various technological fields.
