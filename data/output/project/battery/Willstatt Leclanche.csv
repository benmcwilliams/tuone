The German government announces the launch of a research & production facility for industrial scale lithium-ion cell manufacturing,2019-01-24 10:30:31+00:00,"Leclanché signs MOU with leading German cell manufacturers to support the development of the facility

YVERDON LES BAINS, Switzerland, 24 January 2019 – Leclanché SA (SIX: LECN), one of the world’s leading energy storage solutions companies, today announced that it is to participate in the industrial Consortium which will support and operate a Battery Cell Research Production Centre, a new research and large-scale industrial manufacturing plant for lithium-ion cells, based in Germany.

The Battery Cell Research Production Centre is an initiative launched by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)1 and will receive an investment of 500 million EUROS. It is part of a strategic drive to develop a German-based mass production of lithium-ion cells necessary to meet the demands of the electrification of transport and storage systems.

As the largest cell manufactuer within the Consortium, with world leading in-house technologies from electrochemistry to energy management systems software, Leclanché will be playing a leading role by bringing industrial scale cell manufacturing know-how. The Consortium’s objectives with the facility are to ensure it acts as an enabler for the development of mass industrial production based on state-of-the-art cell chemistry and cell design.

Other participating companies include BMZ Group/ Terra E, Customcells, EAS and Liacon.

The project is a significant win for the German Ministry of Education and Research, Germany, and for Europe at large who need the participation of leading lithium-ion players to build a European-based industry capable of minimising dependence on Asian battery manufacturers.

Meanwhile, Leclanché announced in December 2018 that it would triple current factory capacity to over 3 million cells per year, or 1 GWh per year by 2020. The production of its proprietary cells, Lithium Titanate Oxide (LT)) and Lithium Graphite/NMC, is based in Willstätt, Germany which is currently the largest lithium ion pouch cell production facility in Europe operating since 2012 with a capacity of over 1 million cells. The ramp-up of cell production comes on the back of significant orders in the etransport sector including e-buses, 2-3 wheelers, and electric vehicles in India and Europe, and major breakthroughs in the marine sector with orders exceeding 45 MWh. Leclanché recently achieved the important milestone of 100 MWh of projects around the world.

Leclanché lands fresh funding in bid to treble cell manufacturing capacity,2020-02-19 15:07:00+00:00,"Yesterday (18 February 2020) the vertically-integrated energy storage company confirmed that it agreed to an unsecured convertible loan facility with New Jersey-based Yorkville Advisors with a maximum ceiling of CHF39 million (US$40 million).

The terms of the agreement allow Yorkville to convert each loan note into Leclanché shares and require that drawdowns from the facility be complete within two years.

Initial proceeds from the facility are to be used to fund company operations and a mooted expansion, hinging on a planned uptick in battery cell manufacturing capacity at its plant in Willstätt, Germany.

And Leclanché has tapped up majority shareholder FEFAM to provide a CHF25 million (US$25.4 million) working capital financing convertible facility – itself with a fixed draw down schedule – which chief executive Anil Srivastava said would help finance a trebling of that plant’s capacity.

That investment comes less than two years after investor group FEFAM last provided Leclanché with a cash injection, having ploughed some CHF75 million (US$76 million) into the company in June 2018.

It also comes amidst a growing appetite from investors for upstream energy storage manufacturing companies, especially in Europe. In the middle of last year Sweden’s Northvolt toasted a US$1 billion raise from parties including BMW, Volkswagen and Goldman Sachs, which it has earmarked to establish gigawatt-level factories strategically throughout Europe.

David Gonzalez, partner and general counsel at Yorkville Advisors, said that what Leclanché had achieved in the energy storage was “Impressive”, adding the funder’s belief that the company had “tremendous long-term growth potential”.

In total, Leclanché said it had now raised around CHF64 million (US$65 million) in growth funding already this year.

Having left its original location in Yverdon-les-Bains, Switzerland, in 2008, Leclanché began to develop battery cells in Willstätt a year later, gradually ramping up the facility’s output. A one million lithium-ion cell production line was installed in 2012 before being ramped up in 2013, however the firm has since produced lithium titanate, lithium graphite/NMC and graphite NMC chemistry cells.",https://www.energy-storage.news/leclanche-lands-fresh-funding-in-bid-to-treble-cell-manufacturing-capacity/
Leclanché secures $65 million investment to triple battery making capacity in Europe,2020-02-20 14:03:43+00:00,"Investments totaling CHF64 million ($65 million) will allow Swiss lithium-ion battery maker Leclancé to triple its manufacturing capacity at its German plant.

The funds— one for CHF 39 million ($40 million) and one for CHF 25 million ($25 million)— will allow the company to triple the volume of cells that it manufactures in Germany to three million cells and to fund the delivery of the company’s order book.

The largest deal with US-based Yorkville Advisors Global, is for an unsecured US dollars convertible loan facility with a maximum ceiling of USD 40 million (apround CHF 39 million).

The first tranche of the loan facility is CHF 2.9 million ($3 million) which has already been expended. Additional drawdowns are expected to be in the amount of CHF 1.4 million ($1.4 million) or an amount determined by both Leclanché and Yorkville Advisors.

The second investment of CHF25 million by FEFAM, its largest shareholder.",https://www.bestmag.co.uk/leclanche-secures-65-million-investment-triple-battery-making-capacity-europe/

Leclanché receives order for a 15 MWh battery storage project from swb in Germany,2017-11-06 11:19:19+01:00,"Leclanché SA (SIX: LECN), one of the world's leading energy storage solution companies, announced today that it has received an order for a 15 MWh (EUR 5 million) battery storage project from swb, an energy services provider in Germany.

The hybrid storage solution developed by swb consists of six Leclanché storage containers, which interact with a swb thermal storage infrastructure to ensure cost effective grid ancillary services. Usual battery storage applications use the battery for symmetrical services, such as charging and discharging. The better value heat system replaces the “charge” part of swb's symmetrical storage infrastructure. The main purpose of the hybrid system is the optimisation of investment and operational costs. Commissioning of the complete system is scheduled for March 2018.

Anil Srivastava, CEO of Leclanché, said: “We are delighted to receive this order from swb. It endorses our software and system integration capability and experience of delivering similar projects around the world, and further solidifies our 2018 business outlook and path to EBITDA breakeven.”

Hybrid and stand-alone battery energy storage systems have the ability to replace grid ancillary services provided today by conventional power stations, contributing to a far more environmentally-friendly stabilisation of the grid.

Energy storage solutions have a significant role to play in the global utility scale generation (stabilisation and peak-shifting) and micro grids (renewable integration) industries, which are expected to see a Combined Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 48 per cent to a value of $4.2bn in the four years to 2020, according to Navigant Research.",https://www.pv-magazine.com/press-releases/leclanche-receives-order-for-a-15-mwh-battery-storage-project-from-swb-in-germany/
