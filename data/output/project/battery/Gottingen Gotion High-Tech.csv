China’s Gotion launches battery production in Germany,2023-09-19 00:00:00,"China battery heavyweight Gotion High Tech has flipped the switch on its first production line at a former Bosch plant in Göttingen, central Germany.

The current production capacity plan for the Göttingen factory is 20 GWh which is expected to be completed in four phases. By mid-2024, the actual production capacity may reach 5 GWh, said the manufacturer.

Once fully operational, the plant is estimated to generate an annual output value of EUR 2 billion ($ 2,14 billion), as company representative said at the official launch held on Saturday.

“Our Göttingen factory's production line is highly automated, with an overall automation level of nearly 70%, and close to 80% in the module assembly stage,” said Ray Chen, vice president of Gotion Global.

The company said it expects to start supplying products for European customers from October. The battery pack products from the factory include those for commercial vehicles, energy storage systems, and passenger vehicles, the company said. Additionally, the factory will serve as an R&D, logistics, and after-sales service center for Gotion's European production and operations base.

Gotion said that it has received “a large number of orders from Europe” for its “Made in Germany” products. On Saturday alone, it signed cooperation agreements with five global companies.

Specifically, Gotion will continue to collaborate with BASF China on battery material-related projects. Gotion and Switzerland’s ABB will work together on battery product supply and technology R&D, to support the Chinese manufacturer’s new factories in Europe and the United States.

Cooperation with Dutch manufacturer of electric buses Ebusco will focus on the development and production of energy storage battery systems and wind and solar energy storage projects. Gotion will also cooperate with Ficosa and Idneo in intelligent mobile energy storage and charging vehicles, battery banking, battery recycling, BMS, and Big Data engineering.

The Volkswagen-backed battery maker is on a steep growth trajectory and has commissioned or announced the construction of numerous battery factories, primarily in China.

On Monday, Gotion and Slovak battery startup Inobat said they will jointly build an electric vehicles battery factory in Europe by 2026 with an initial output of 20 GWh. Construction is expected to begin in 2024 and the final location of the plant is yet to be announced.

Gotion is also building a $2.36 billion battery plant in Michigan and a $2 billion plant in Illinois in the US. In June, it became known that Gotion was considering building a 100 GWh battery cell factory in Morocco.

As reveled in a recent pv magazine webinar, Gotion wants to reach a global production capacity of 300 GWh by 2026 with 100 GWh oversees, including 40 GWh in Europe alone.",https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/09/19/chinas-gotion-launches-battery-production-in-germany/
Gotion High-Tech to open cell plant in Illinois in 2024,2023-09-11 00:00:00,"In the USA, Chinese battery cell manufacturer and Volkswagen partner Gotion High-Tech is converting an existing factory in Manteno, Illinois, into a 50 GWh plant. The plant should be ready for operations in 2024 with 40 GWh targeted for battery cells and 10 GWh for battery packs.

According to an official statement from the state of Illinois, Gotion High-Tech plans to invest $2 billion – the equivalent of around €1.86 billion – to convert and equip the production facility. The Chinese manufacturer can count on state subsidies of $536 million for the factory, which is expected to create 2,600 jobs. Although details have not yet been released on the type of cells and packs, battery products made there will go to “existing Gotion partners as well as other EV manufacturers across North America.”

The state of Michigan had initially been under discussion as the location for Gotion’s U.S. factory, as indicated in 2022 by the company’s application for U.S. government subsidies. Gotion is said to have calculated investments of 2.36 billion US dollars and a start-up in 2024. Ultimately, Illinois won the bid for the plant’s location.

The Illinois government and local stakeholders speak of a “historic investment.” The Chinese company’s search for a location was well-timed for Illinois. In early 2023, the Invest in Illinois fund was signed into law in early 2023 to make Illinois more attractive when vying for large projects in highly competitive sectors like clean energy. Gotion High Tech is to be awarded $125 million in capital funding from Invest in Illinois. Local authorities also approved a property tax abatement for the plant for the next 30 years.

The US state is going to maximise the benefit of the large battery maker in the region by building out comprehensive EV hubs and supporting Illinois’ workforce by funding a new manufacturing training academy nearby. Illinois will also award an additional grant to workforce providers to expand training and prepare regional employees for the new jobs.

Jack Lavin, President & CEO of Chicagoland Chamber of Commerce, summarised: “Between today’s announcement, recent investments in the electric vehicle space throughout the state, and thanks to our skilled and diverse talent pool, world-class universities, and key infrastructure, it’s clear Illinois is well-positioned to be a leader in the electric vehicle space.”

Mark Denzler, President & CEO of the Illinois Manufacturers’ Association, said the site selection in Illinois was a “huge win” for the governor and the state of Illinois. “It builds on our state’s long history of auto manufacturing, and we are thrilled to welcome Gotion to Illinois as we work diligently to create an innovative ecosystem that supports our growing electric vehicle sector.”

Li Zhen, chairperson of Gotion High-Tech, said: “All that we see here [in Illinois] are of enormous value to us: an enabling business environment, a supportive state government for the new energy industry and their highly efficient work, as well as the prospects of the State of Illinois in the coming years.”

Li Zhen also emphasized that reusing an existing factory is happening against a backdrop of respectful use of resources. On an international level, Li Zhen said: “We believe that Gotion’s battery technology will help to boost e-mobility in North America and the economic and trade exchanges between China and the U.S.”

Gotion High-Tech (25.6 per cent of the shares are owned by Volkswagen) specializes in LFP cells. The company is on a trajectory of rapid growth and has commissioned or announced the construction of numerous battery factories, mostly located in China. In Germany, the company is scheduled to start production in Göttingen before the end of 2023. By 2025, Gotion aims to reach a global production capacity of 300 GWh. The Chinese battery company is also planning, constructing or operating plants in Vietnam and Thailand and is eyeing up possibilities for a plant in Morocco.

In December 2021, Gotion announced that it had signed a supply agreement with a major publicly traded US automaker. The agreement covers the supply of 200 GWh of LFP cells from 2023 to 2028, which will be cells manufactured in China. However, it was also said that the partners plan to localize the production and supply of LFP batteries in the U.S. Based on the information at the time, Tesla was considered a possible partner because Tesla already relies on LFP cells (primarily from CATL) on a large scale. A battery plant in Illinois would make little sense for Tesla, with its plants in California and Texas, so the publicly listed US automaker spoken of by the Korean battery manufacturer might be more likely to be another company.

ABB to support Gotion High-Tech’s new battery factories,2023-12-13 00:00:00,"A memorandum of understanding signed by the two companies at the first Gotion battery factory in Göttingen, Germany, provides for developing a “master design plan” combining automation, electrification and digital technologies.

According to ABB, the aim is to “increase throughput with a higher level of automation, optimisation and emission control.” ABB would further provide standardised modular power distribution solutions that are scalable and replicable.

This is crucial since Gotion is currently significantly expanding its production capacities. A 50 GWh factory under construction in the US state of Illinois is relevant for the deal with ABB. The Chinese are also considering a 100 GWh factory in Morocco and, together with InoBat, a production facility in Slovakia, as reported.

Moreover, ABB also seems interested in Gotion’s batteries. The press statement mentions a joint project team completing a feasibility assessment to introduce ABB products and services into Gotion. Yet it also explores an R&D collaboration to “understand how battery cells, modules and packs from Gotion High-Tech could be supplied to ABB and its affiliates”. The company adds that it would explore the potential use of Gotion products for a wide range of industrial applications, including marine, traction, microgrids, high, medium and low voltage, and renewables.

Staffan Sodergard, Business Unit Manager, Battery Manufacturing, Process Industries, ABB, called the deal a “new milestone” for ABB in battery manufacturing. He added, “manufacturing of batteries en masse remained a “top priority to ensure that there is availability and consistent supply within the global market.”

“Our partnership with ABB will lead to a position where we can contribute towards the significantly high demand for electric vehicles in Europe and the US,” said Li Zhen, Chairman of Gotion. “We’re confident that ABB’s approaches are proven to scale up operations quickly while ensuring safety and environmental responsibility are addressed at every stage.”

It is also the next mighty partner for the Chinese company. Gotion had brought Siemens on board in September to develop its factories but did not limit this partnership to the European and North American markets. At the time, Siemens stated that the Chinese battery cell manufacturer was using its Xcelerator portfolio to digitalise its battery development and production to “implement smart factories”.

Gotion High-Tech is also a partner of Volkswagen, and the carmaker has a 26.5 per cent stake.

"Gotion is bringing a $2 billion EV battery gigafactory to Illinois, creating thousands of jobs",2023-09-08 00:00:00,"Global EV battery developer Gotion High-Tech has announced a major investment in the state of Illinois to the tune of $2 billion to erect a new gigafactory in Manteno – about 50 miles south of Chicago. With logistic and financial support from the state, Gotion’s new plant becomes the largest investment in EV battery technology in Illinois history.

Gotion High-Tech Co., Ltd. is a battery R&D and energy solutions provider that is headquartered in China, but has footprints on continents all over the world, including Fremont, CA – home to Tesla’s original gigafactory. Most recently, Gotion has been expanding to Vietnam via a joint venture with VinES, the energy division of VinFast.

The company specializes in several different types of battery chemistries, particularly in support of the automotive segment. This includes new lithium-iron-manganese-phosphate (LMFP) batteries (seen below) promising 1,000 km (621 miles) of range on a single charge, as well as lithium-iron-phosphate (LFP) batteries that we’ve reported on in the past, as Tesla was at one point rumored to be helping bring a factory to the US.

While we have no confirmation that Tesla is involved in any way, Gotion High-Tech has found a home for its US EV battery manufacturing plant – Illinois. Beginning next year, the company intends to begin producing batteries for automakers based all around North America.

Gotion’s plant the largest EV battery investment in Illinois

Gotion High-Tech and Illinois Governor JB Pritzker joined local state leaders in the city Manteno – the future home of the EV battery manufacturing facility announced today. Gotion shared that the roughly 150-acre site will focus on the production of lithium-ion cells, battery packs, and energy storage system integration.

When complete, the state-of-the-art facility is expected to produce 10 gigawatt-hours (GWh) of lithium-ion packs and 40 GWh of li-ion cells – all in support of the local US EV supply chain. Gotion cited plans to manufacture batteries for its current partners as well as “additional EV manufacturers across North America.” During today’s press event in Manteno, Governor Pritzker spoke:

Today, we take another leap forward, announcing the largest electric vehicle battery production investment in Illinois to date. It’s my pleasure to welcome a world-leading battery manufacturer – Gotion – to Illinois. This announcement is a testament to Illinois status as a leading destination for companies and investors who want the most talented workers, the best transportation systems, and a collaborative economic growth mindset from their partners in government at all levels. With 2,600 new jobs, a $2 billion gigafactory, and the most significant new manufacturing investment in Illinois in decades – it’s the most recent proof that we are in a new paradigm. Illinois is on the rise, and we’re open for business.

Gotion’s decision to call The Land of Lincoln its new home was hardened by Pritzker and the state’s REV (Reimagining Energy and Vehicles) Illinois incentive package, plus a new fun called “Invest in Illinois.” Pritzker has been publicly courting prospective OEMs in the EV sector to come to Illinois and Gotion is now the first to take advantage of Invest in Illinois – which will provide the EV battery developer with $125 million in capital.

The state shared that Gotion’s entire incentive package is valued at $536 million and includes eligibility to receive $213 million in tax benefits over the next 30 years through REV. To qualify, Gotion must invest a minimum of $1.9 million and create at least 2,600 full-time jobs that pay at least 120% of the average wage for similar positions in Manteno’s Kankakee County.

The REV agreement has been fully executed, meaning the central Illinois city can expect to see thousands of job openings over the course of the next year. Lastly, Gotion will also receive 30 years of property tax abatement which has already been approved by local authorities. Gotion chairman Li Zhen spoke to the company’s new EV battery plant’s potential in a state like Illinois:

Energy and environmental protection are our common challenges. To address them, solar power, wind, and energy storage systems are becoming the backbone of a new energy system and accelerate the revolution in the global energy landscape. All that we see here [in Illinois] are of enormous value to us: an enabling business environment, a supportive state government for the new energy industry and their highly efficient work, as well as the prospects of the State of Illinois in the coming years. When we come to Illinois, we are not building a new factory but are planning to reuse an existing one and bring it back to life again as our way of cherishing and conserving resources. We believe that Gotion’s battery technology will help to boost e-mobility in North America and the economic and trade exchanges between China and the US.

Gotion says the new facility is expected to begin EV battery production in 2024. Illinois will also fund a manufacturing training academy nearby to prepare regional employees for jobs in the next-generation battery segment.",https://electrek.co/2023/09/08/gotion-bringing-2-billion-ev-battery-gigafactory-to-illinois-jobs/
