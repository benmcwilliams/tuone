UK: Envision AESC lays foundation for Sunderland gigafactory,2022-12-12 00:00:00,"Envision AESC has begun the building works for its battery factory near the Nissan plant in Sunderland, UK. It will be the second UK facility for the EV battery specialist from Japan. Envision AESC also announced new details regarding capacities after reports had varied.

Once the new plant comes on stream in 2025, it will have an annual capacity of 12 GWh, writes Envision in today’s announcement. This is more than the 9 GWh the company had set when publishing the plans for Sunderland in July 2021. A few months later, in October, Envision CEO Zhang Lei named an initial capacity of 11 GWh, but already for 2024. But going back to the latest news, expansion, so far, has been forecasted as 25 GWh by 2030 and ultimately up to 35 GWh.

The type of cell AESC will be making for Nissan here has remained unchanged, with Envision saying it would produce its latest generation batteries with 30% more energy density. They further promise to deliver enough batteries to power 100,000 electric vehicles annually. They did not provide more details, and it remains unclear whether the facility will manufacture cells or also house the assembly of entire battery modules.

However, Nissan’s presence in Sunderland and cooperation with AESC have been longstanding. Nissan Europe Vice President of Engineering Andy Marsh explained how the first Sunderland battery plant helped launch the 100% electric Nissan LEAF and expects the second factory to become “a fundamental part of our EV36Zero project, which brings together electric vehicle production, battery manufacturing and renewables as we drive towards carbon neutrality”.

The EV36Zero initiative is worth £1 billion to Nissan and Envision AESC with the cooperation of the Sunderland Council. As battery partner Envision pledged to invest £450 million (about €525 mn) in the UK’s “first Gigafactory”. Nissan, in turn, promised up to £423 mn to produce another electric model in Sunderland in form of an all-electric crossover model based on the CMF EV platform from the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi alliance. Nissan plans to create a production capacity of 100,000 vehicles per year in Sunderland.

According to the Japanese partners, the announced projects will create 6,200 jobs at Nissan and its UK suppliers, including more than 900 new Nissan jobs and 750 new Envision AESC jobs at its battery plant. Envision AESC also says it will increase the above initial investment of £450 mn in the manufacturing facility to £1.8 billion “in a later phase”, the equivalent of around €2.1 bn, and today spoke of employing up to 4,500 staff.

The company is already known to operate a 1.9 GWh plant on site, built in 2012 under Nissan. At the time, AESC was still working as a battery subsidiary of the Japanese carmaker before Nissan sold AESC to Envision Group in 2018. Within the last nine years, “enough cells, modules and packs for over 180,000 electric vehicles in 44 countries” have been produced at the plant, most notably for installation in the Nissan Leaf and e-NV200.

Globally, the second facility is part of Envision’s plan to scale up EV manufacturing capabilities in strategic regions. The plant follows last year’s announcements to build gigafactories in Douai, France, the US state of Kentucky, Ibaraki Japan, and Extremadura in Spain. This brings Envision AESC’s total capacity to more than 150GWh worldwide and advances its commitment to reach 300GWh by 2026.

Envision AESC submitted plans for a gigafactory, which will be built at the International Advanced Manufacturing Park (IAMP) in Washington, earlier this year – with Prime Minister Boris Johnson paying a visit to mark the announcement.

Sunderland City Council leader Graeme Miller at the Nissan press conference to unveil their new Envision-AESC battery plant.

The company is a world-leading manufacturer of lithium-ion batteries for the automotive industry and has been producing batteries in Sunderland for the Nissan LEAF electric vehicle for nearly a decade.

New plans will see the company move to a larger state-of-the-art building on the IAMP site as part of a £1billion partnership with Nissan UK and Sunderland City Council to create an electric vehicle hub supporting the next generation of electric vehicle production.

The scaled-up plant, which is capable of producing batteries to power more than 100,000 electric vehicles per year, will be powered by 100% renewable energy and supported by a ‘microgrid’ which is being developed by Sunderland City Council.

“We are immensely proud of the work we have done with our strategic partners Nissan UK and Sunderland City Council so far, which has laid the foundations for affordable EVs and sustainable growth in the region for the next generations.""

He added: “As a growing global business, we will continue to push the boundaries of battery technology, which has made us a world leading battery supplier, with a safety record that boasts no critical incidents during the last 10 years.”

Nissan Sunderland Plant Vice President, Manufacturing, Alan Johnson said: “This is a fundamental part of our EV36Zero project, bringing together electric vehicle production, battery manufacturing and renewables, and we’re all excited to see the progress being made.”

Lynda Newsome, of planning and development consultancy Lichfields, spoke on behalf of Envision AESC at the meeting.

She said: “Overall the proposals will help Sunderland and the UK become one of the best international locations for automotive and advanced manufacturing, with the proposals building on both Nissan and Envision’s initial investments in the Nissan LEAF in the current battery plant.”

Although concerns were raised by councillor Len Lauchlan about the “nasty chemicals” used in lithium-ion battery production and the safety measures in place, council planners said this would be monitored by a seperate process.

This includes an additional application for ‘hazardous substances’ which will be considered by the council, working alongside the Environment Agency and Health and Safety Executive.

Envision is working in partnership with Nissan and Sunderland City Council on the battery plant scheme which is expected to secure jobs and economic growth for the region.

According to a report prepared for councillors, construction is due to begin in early 2022, with the aim of starting battery production in 2024.

The Prime Minister gave his seal of approval to the plans when the announcement was made earlier this year – stating that the high-skilled jobs the plant will create will support many future generations.

When completed, the gigafactory will be the largest facility on the IAMP site, which was created by South Tyneside Council and Sunderland City Council in 2018 to attract business investment to the region.",https://www.sunderlandecho.com/news/politics/council/plans-approved-for-ps450million-envision-gigafactory-battery-3409592
UK battery ‘gigafactory’ plans huge expansion as electric car demand soars,2021-10-25 00:00:00,"The Chinese owner of the UK’s only large-scale battery factory has revealed plans for a big expansion that will put the plant in Sunderland among the biggest electric vehicle facilities in Europe.

Envision said annual capacity at the plant would eventually rise to 38 gigawatt hours (GWh), an increase from a previous plan of 11GWh that was announced in July as part of a supply deal for the Japanese carmaker Nissan’s Sunderland plant.

Battery companies are investing billions of pounds around the world in new facilities as they race to match the accelerating demand for electric vehicles.

Lei Zhang, the chief executive of Envision, said the Shanghai-based company was in talks with global carmakers about using the Sunderland plant, and another in France, to supply their car factories, in an interview with the Financial Times.

The Sunderland “gigafactory”, currently capable of annual output of 1.7GWh, was first opened in 2012 to build batteries for Nissan’s Leaf electric vehicle, which is manufactured next door. Nissan will build a crossover sports utility vehicle as a successor to the Leaf, which was for a long time the most popular battery electric vehicle on British roads until it was overtaken this year by the Model 3 from the US electric car pioneer Tesla.

Envision took ownership of the Sunderland factory in 2019 when it bought Nissan’s battery company. Zhang said the manufacturer, which also produces wind turbines, intended to list its battery business, a move that would allow it to fund its new plants.

A plant of 38GWh would be a significant step towards filling the gap in UK production. The UK-government-backed Faraday Institution has calculated that the UK will require annual battery output of about 140GWh a year by 2040 if it is to sustain a car industry of similar size after the transition away from internal combustion engines. Failure to secure gigafactories in the UK could lead to the industry shrinking by more than 100,000 jobs.

In the UK the only other publicly disclosed plan for further battery production is from Britishvolt, which hopes to produce 30GWh a year by 2027. The project is not yet fully funded, although the startup has received investment from Glencore, the metals trading company. Britishvolt is considering a stock market listing in London to raise capital.

Local politicians in the West Midlands have a separate plan to attract investment in a gigafactory at Coventry airport. They have secured pre-emptive planning permission for the site but no investor has yet committed.

Globally there are plans for 247 battery plants with a total output of more than 4,600 GWh, according to Benchmark Minerals, a data company. The industry is dominated by Asian companies, including China’s Contemporary Amperex Technology Ltd, South Korea’s LG and Japan’s Panasonic.

Europe and the US are generally regarded to be behind in producing car batteries. However, a wave of investment has swelled in Europe in recent years, including inward investment by Asian companies and startups such as Northvolt.",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/oct/25/uk-battery-gigafactory-electric-car-sunderland-envision-nissan
Nissan confirms Sunderland battery plant & new BEV model,2021-07-01 00:00:00,"Nissan has now officially confirmed that Envision AESC will build a battery factory at its plant in Sunderland, England. A new electric model will also be produced there in the future. Both announcements are part of a £1 billion initiative by Nissan and Envision AESC called EV36Zero.

++ This article has been updated. Kindly continue reading below. ++

The battery factory of the Chinese partner Envision AESC will be larger than previously reported: the factory should now have an initial annual capacity of 9 GWh and grow to 25 GWh by 2030. Potentially, up to 35 GWh will be possible. By comparison, media reports recently spoke of an initial capacity of 6 GWh and later 18 to 20 GWh.

It is now also official that the battery factory will produce, among other things, a new type of cell with a 30 per cent higher energy density. However, Nissan did not go into more detail on this topic. It is also not mentioned whether only cells will be produced in the factory or whether modules and systems will also be assembled. The latter can be assumed, however, as the neighbouring vehicle plant presumably takes over the batteries in ready-to-install condition.

Battery partner Envision AESC says it will initially invest £450 million (about 525 million euros) in the ‘UK’s first Gigafactory’. This will be built at the International Advanced Manufacturing Park (IAMP), adjacent to the Nissan plant, where it can be “powered by renewable energy and pioneering next-generation battery technology”. Nissan says that the formal planning process for the plant is imminent. The company has not yet given a date for commissioning. Media reports have given 2024 as the target opening year.

While the location of the battery cell plant is no surprise (a feasibility study supported by the British government was launched in November 2020), in the same breath, Nissan has also announced that it will invest up to £423 million to produce a new electric model in Sunderland. This will be an all-electric crossover model based on the CMF EV platform from the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi alliance, for which Nissan plans to create production capacity for 100,000 vehicles per year in Sunderland.

The model will be designed for global sales and exported from UK production to those European markets traditionally served by Nissan’s Sunderland plant. Nissan has not yet confirmed any other production locations for the electric vehicle. Further details about the new vehicle are also to be announced later.

Both announcements are part of the “transformational project clustered around Sunderland” called EV36Zero, which is being launched with an initial investment of £1 billion (around €1.17 billion) by Nissan, Envision AESC and Sunderland City Council. The project comprises three interlinked initiatives that bring together electric vehicles, renewable energy and battery production. The aim is for the North East of the UK to become the new EV hub, with research and development around the entire battery lifecycle, including storage and secondary use of batteries, through to intelligent V2G charging and closed-loop recycling.

As a special project in this context, Nissan is holding out the prospect of a microgrid. According to initial plans, ten solar farms with an expected capacity of 132 MW could be linked to Nissan’s existing wind and solar farms and connected directly to the UK grid to supply Nissan and the automotive companies located in the adjacent International Advanced Manufacturing Park. The plans are being developed in close consultation with potential green investors from the private sector. It will be managed by Sunderland City Council. The initial investment is estimated at £80 million (around 93 million euros).

According to Nissan, it is also conceivable that a 1 MW battery storage system could be integrated into the microgrid, which could consist of used Nissan EV/Envision AESC batteries and serve to temporarily store surplus renewable energy. Part of the background to the initiative is that Sunderland has committed to becoming a carbon-neutral city by 2040.

According to the Japanese partners, the announced projects will create 6,200 jobs at Nissan and its UK suppliers, including more than 900 new Nissan jobs and 750 new Envision AESC jobs at its battery plant. Envision AESC also says it will increase the above initial investment of £450 million in the manufacturing facility to £1.8 billion “in a later phase”, the equivalent of around 2.1 billion euros.

The company is already known to operate a 1.9 GWh plant on site, which was built in 2012 still under the direction of Nissan. At the time, AESC was still operating as a battery subsidiary under the umbrella of the Japanese carmaker. Within the last nine years, “enough cells, modules and packs for over 180,000 electric vehicles in 44 countries” have been produced at the plant. Most notably for installation in the Nissan Leaf and e-NV200.

In 2018, Nissan sold its battery subsidiary to Envision Group Envision AESC. The latter has since maintained the Sunderland plant but also operates facilities in Japan and the United States. According to the company, annual production capacity adds up to 7.5 GWh, which comes together from 3 GWh in the US state of Tennessee, 2.6 GWh in Kanagawa, Japan, and the said 1.9 GWh in Sunderland, UK. AESC Envision has also started construction of a plant in Wuxi, China, in 2019, which is expected to have an annual capacity of 20 GWh.

Nissan’s vehicle production in Sunderland has been in place for 35 years. Current production includes the Nissan Qashqai, Juke and Leaf, most of which (70 per cent) are exported to mainland Europe. 20 per cent are sold in the UK and a further 10 per cent are exported to markets around the globe. Also based in the UK are Nissan’s European design centre in Paddington, London and its research and development centre in Cranfield, Bedfordshire.

Update 20 December 2022

Nissan’s UK plant in Sunderland has produced its 250,000 Leaf electric vehicle. In 2021, Nissan’s Sunderland plant was announced as the home of EV36ZERO, a £1 billion flagship electric vehicle manufacturing ecosystem bringing together electric vehicles, renewable energy and battery production.

“This year we have completely electrified the plant’s line-up with the new versions of Qashqai and Juke launched, so lighting up the Christmas tree with our original EV is a spectacular and appropriate way to end 2022,” explained Alan Johnson, Vice President of Manufacturing at the Sunderland plant, adding: “Passing a quarter of a million Nissan LEAF is a tremendous milestone, and demonstrates the electric vehicle manufacturing expertise we have built up at our plant over the past decade.”

AESC raises the stakes on BMW battery cell production in the USA,2023-12-15 00:00:00,"According to the South Carolina Department of Commerce, AESC is increasing its investment by a further 810 million to 1.62 billion dollars to expand production capacity at the plant under construction in Florence County. Exactly how much capacity is not mentioned.

AESC initially laid out the factory for 30-gigawatt hours and expects the plant to come on stream in 2026. As part of the expansion, the company says it will create 1,620 jobs instead of the planned 1,170 – recruitment is ongoing.

The factory in Florence County slated for expansion today is one of three battery plants the Japanese firm is running in the US. Therefore, the final production capacity will exceed the previously planned 70 GWh, including the existing battery manufacturing facility in Tennessee (near the Nissan plant there) and a factory under construction in Kentucky (for the Mercedes plant in Tuscaloosa, among others).

As for BMW, AESC reportedly has a contract to supply battery cells for next-gen electric vehicle models, which the German carmaker will produce at Plant Spartanburg in Greer, South Carolina. It is BMW’s only US factory and is scheduled to make at least six all-electric X series models by 2030.

The carmaker has reportedly begun construction of a new assembly plant in Woodruff, South Carolina, where sixth-generation batteries will be assembled for the nearby Spartanburg plant.

Envision AESC is one of three battery partners for BMW’s New Class cars, along with Chinese manufacturers CATL and Eve Energy.

AESC (formerly Envision AESC) added today the round battery format would result in 20% more energy density than the current generation, reduce charging time, and increase range and efficiency for electric vehicles by 30%.

BMW round cells will have a uniform diameter of 46 millimetres and two different heights to be “flexibly integrated into the installation space”. The battery packing takes on a supporting role in the body structure. In technical jargon, this battery concept is called “pack-to-open-body”. It is also known that New Class vehicles will use an 800-volt system with up to 350 kW charging power.

Wates starts construction on Envision AESC’s second UK gigafactory



Wates has began construction on a new gigafactory in Sunderland, for Envision AESC, a world-leading Japanese electric vehicle battery technology company.

Envision AESC’s new UK gigafactory will support over 1,000 hi-tech jobs

The company’s second Sunderland factory will deliver a six-fold increase in UK electric vehicle battery production in the UK

A traditional Japanese first pillar ceremony marked the first phase of construction and celebrated ten years of electric vehicle battery production in Sunderland

Play Video Wates and Envision AESC – First Pillar Ceremony The project the largest by single value in Wates’ 125-year history is AESC’s second Sunderland battery plant. It will have capacity of 12 GWh and will employ more than a 1,000 people when operational in 2025. It will be powered by 100% net zero Carbon energy, aligning with the company’s global commitment to sustainability.

The state-of-the-art facility will produce AESC’s latest generation batteries, with 30% more energy density to improve range and efficiency, and manufacture enough batteries to power 100,000 electric vehicles annually.

It forms part of a wider £1bn partnership with Nissan and Sunderland City Council to create EV36Zero, an electric vehicle hub supporting next generation EV production and accelerating the transition to net zero carbon mobility.

A traditional Japanese first pillar ceremony marked the first phase of work on Friday 9th December, with AESC CEO Shoichi Matsumoto tightening the bolt on the building’s ‘first pillar’ – a traditional Japanese custom on construction projects. The ceremony also marked a decade of EV battery production on Wearside with the first electric vehicle battery built back in 2012, to support production of the first-generation Nissan LEAF.

The company has doubled in size since production began and today employs more than 470 people in Sunderland. Globally AESC batteries are found in 800,000 electric vehicles operating with zero critical incidents.

The footprint of the new building will be the equivalent of 23 football pitches and use 14000 km of mains cables. When complete the 360m long building will be longer than the nearby Northern Spire bridge across the River Wear.

The latest integrated Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) smart technology will be deployed to monitor and optimise energy consumption, manufacturing and maintenance at the gigafactory.

Construction of the new building on the IAMP business park – which spans land in South Tyneside and Sunderland will pave the way for potential future investment that could eventually see the site generate 35GWh capacity and 4,500 new high value green jobs.

Wates, alongside its specialist engineering services arm, SES Engineering Services, is leading the design and delivery of the build, working alongside Turner & Townsend who will act as the project manager and cost manager.

The first pillar event marks the latest phase of Envision AESC’s investment in the UK and is a sign of our ongoing commitment to Sunderland. Our ambitious growth plans are built on a focus on quality, which is why we have over 800,000 electric vehicle batteries on the road globally with zero critical incidents.



I want to pay tribute to the fantastic team in Sunderland who over the past decade have helped ensure each and every battery is built without compromise and helped make AESC a leading battery supplier.” Shoichi Matsumoto Envision AESC CEO

Envision AESC is the largest single project by value in our 125-year history. We are integrating years of expertise from across our business and supply partners to deliver this immensely complex scheme.
