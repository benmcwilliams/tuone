ACC granted funding to make batteries in Germany,2021-09-02 00:00:00,"ACC, the Franco-German initiative comprising PSA, Opel and Saft, has received funding notifications from the Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology (BMVi) and the state of Rhineland-Palatinate to start constructing a battery cell factory in Germany as part of the EU’s Battery IPCEI.

The federal and state governments are funding the project with a total of 436.8 million euros. They expect to see the joint venture Automotive Cell Company (ACC) start making batteries at the Opel plant in Kaiserslautern in two years.

Many steps have preceded the handover of the funding notification. ACC was founded at the end of 2018 in expectation of the European call for battery manufacturing, then still running under the catchphrase “Battery Airbus”. In December 2019, the EU Commission approved the first round of the official ‘Battery IPCEI’ as an “important project of common European interest.” At that time, a total of €3.2 billion in funding was earmarked for pan-European research and innovation projects from seven member states on all segments of the battery value chain.

In the case of ACC, the Franco-German consortium fired the starting gun to kick-off pilot production in January 2020 at a Saft facility in France. The partners will develop cell technology there before beginning production at scale at the actual battery plants in Douvrin and Kaiserslautern, each with a volume of 24 GWh per year.

The funding decision for 436.8 million has now been handed over to ACC, which PSA, its subsidiary Opel and TotalEnergies subsidiary Saft officially established in September 2020 for battery cell production. The sum already includes 51 million euros from the state of Rhineland-Palatinate, so the BMWi is taking over around 386 million euros. The companies involved in the joint venture are investing over two billion euros for this purpose.

At the handover ceremony, German Economics Minister Peter Altmaier spoke of a “very important milestone” and repeated the ambition for “the most innovative, sustainable and efficient batteries to come from Germany and Europe.” He added the new battery cell plant would secure around 2,000 jobs and, in future, produce battery cells for around 500,000 electric vehicles annually. “With batteries made in Germany, we secure the added value and jobs of tomorrow!” Altmaier said.

ACC CEO Yann Vincent sees an important step in the company’s still young history. “This vote of confidence from the German authorities reinforces our ambition to become a European leader in the development and manufacture of batteries for electric vehicles and to enable clean and affordable mobility for all,” Vincent said. “The agreement signed with the German government reflects this ambition.”

The first phase of construction will lead to 8 GWh output and is scheduled to start in 2023. Battery production in Kaiserslautern is expected to begin in 2025, according to Ralph Wangemann, Opel’s Managing Director of HR and Labour. Subsequently, two more blocks with eight GWh each are to be built to reach the targeted production of 24 GWh.

On Linkedin, however, ACC mentions a second “gigafactory”, the one in France, set to start producing battery cells in 2024, in line with a previous target. The company added that the second plant “should allow us to reach our production objective of 48GWh by the end of 2028.” We assume this is the total production.

Back in Germany, the BMWi announced all five approved projects from the first battery IPCEI have started. For the second battery IPCEI that saw Tesla competing as well, six of eleven projects are underway. These are also expected to receive funding notices “in the coming weeks,” the ministry said.

Germany: ACC Receives €437 Million To Build Battery Gigafactory,2021-09-06,"Automotive Cells Company (ACC), the battery joint venture between PSA Group (Stellantis) and Total, established in September 2020, will receive substantial funding in Germany.

In total, the company will get about €437 million ($519 million), including €386 million from the Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology (BMVi) and €52 million from the state of Rhineland-Palatinate, to build its first battery gigafactory in Kaiserslautern, in Rhineland-Palatinate state.

Construction of the plant is scheduled to start in 2023, while the production should begin in 2025. The plant is expected to have manufacturing capacity of 8 GWh annually, which will be expanded to 24 GWh annually later this decade.

Once completed, the plant is expected to supply enough battery cells for up to 500,000 electric cars annually.

Comparing the manufacturing output with the scale of incentives looks heavily subsidized, just to support the German Opel brand (part of Stellantis) and create up to 2,000 jobs.

The second Automotive Cells Company - a similar 8/24 GWh gigafactory - will be built in France, probably a year later.

In total, Automotive Cells Company intends to invest some €5 billion in the two plants, but €1.3 billion is expected to come from the European Union.

The lithium-ion technology will be provided by Total's subsidiary Saft, which currently is building a €200 million pilot plant at its Nersac facility.

In the broader picture, ACC will be only one of many battery suppliers for Stellantis, as the company already has contracts with CATL, BYD, SVOLT, Samsung SDI and LG Chem's LG Energy Solution.

We guess that depending on the competitiveness of the in-house battery production, Stellantis will decide whether to expand ACC or continue to rely on external suppliers.",https://insideevs.com/news/530878/germany-acc-437-million-gigafactory/
A PSA-Total battery factory for Hauts-de-France,,"The “Airbus of batteries”: a project worth more than €5 billion

Announced in January 2020, the project to build an automotive ‘gigafactory’ was confirmed on Thursday 3 September 2020, with the creation of the Automotive Cells Company, a 50/50 joint venture between PSA/Open and Total/Saft. ACC will manage the future factories at Douvrin (Hauts-de-France) and in Kaiserslautern in Germany. This project represents an investment of more than €5 billion, including financial support of €1.3 billion from the French and German public authorities.

The French gigafactory: a two stage project

Stage 1: R&D Backed by Total’s expertise, ACC’s R&C will focus on developing high-performance lithium-ion batteries.

Development has already started at the R&D site in Bordeaux (Gironde) and the pilot site in Nersac (Charente-Maritime). Stage 2: Mass production The PSA group will bring its knowledge of the automotive market and experience in mass production to the two sites:

Douvrin in France (Hauts-de-France region)

Kaiserslautern in Germany

Production is due to start in 2023. It will reach full power by 2030 with a cumulative capacity of 48Gwh on both sites, equipping 1 million electric vehicles per year which is more than 10% of the European market.

PSA Gigafactory: Douvrin selected for French production

It’s no coincidence that the French gigafactory is based in Hauts-de-France… The Hauts-de-France region is:

the leading automotive region in France in terms of vehicle production (700,000 per year, 30% of the French total)

the second biggest region for engine production with more than 750,000 units produced every year

It benefits from the presence of 2 global manufacturers (Toyota, PSA and Renault). And an ecosystem of more than 550 suppliers, sub-contractors and service providers. …And it’s no coincidence that PSA chose Douvrin Since 1969 the town has been home to the PSA diesel and petrol engine plant, Française de Mécanique. The factory accounts for nearly 5% of global production of engines for light vehicles of all makes.

Electric vehicles are booming

Driven by environmental protection policies, the electric vehicle sector is growing rapidly in Europe. According to market studies carried out by PSA and Total, it should increase its current production up to 15 times by 2030, a total of 400GWh.

Relocating electric battery manufacturing: a challenge for European sovereignty

This gigafactory project which is supported by the French and German governments aims to:

support energy transition in the automotive industry

ensure Europe’s industrial independence

The major share of the battery production market is held by China and America. The European market represents just 1% of global production. This European gigafactory will help reduce the cost of electric motors and thereby encourage the development of an electric vehicle market in the heart of Europe. It should be noted that a battery alone represents one third of the vehicles added value.
