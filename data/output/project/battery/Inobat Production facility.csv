InoBat begins making battery cells in Slovakia,2023-12-18 00:00:00,"Staying with the pilot line, the new facility was tailor-made for InoBat by Wuxi Lead from China. The line comprises 35 machines, covering the entire production process from preparing anode and cathode mixtures to final formation and ageing, utilising high-speed layering technology.

The transfer of the line from China to Slovakia, as well as its installation and commissioning, was a “demanding logistical process,” writes InoBat. Indeed, the parts had to travel 24,169 kilometres in 44 shipping containers over eight weeks. It took another four months to install it.

Now, 41 operators from InoBat will work in shifts to ensure 24/7 operation and manufacture.

“InoBat’s vision started with a sketch on a napkin and an idea to put Slovakia on the world map of electromobility,” said Marián Boček, CEO of InoBat, as he launched the pilot line this week. “We are very happy that the idea on a napkin quickly turned into a complete project, on which we started working with partners from all over the world.”

Apart from Wuxi Lead, the company reportedly teamed up with Volkswagen partner Gotion High-Tech to build a Slovak battery cell factory with an annual capacity of 20 gigawatt-hours through a joint venture called Gotion InoBat Batteries (GIB). The business could double its capacity to 40 GWh. Production is scheduled to start in the second quarter of 2026, and series production in 2027. The large plant is also located right next to the research & development laboratories in Voderady.

As a side note, Lead is also a partner to Volkswagen when it comes to equipping battery factories starting with the Salzgitter plant, as reported.

Independently of the GIB factory, InoBat is planning a 100 MWh pilot production facility in Voderady and a 10 GWh factory in 2024.

InoBat’s first client is the VTOL startup Lilium from Germany.

Slovakian Company InoBat and Ideanomics Secure Incentives for Joint Venture Battery R&D and ProductionFacility in Indiana,2022-11-01,"Slovakian Company InoBat and Ideanomics Secure Incentives for Joint Venture Battery R&D and Production

Facility in Indiana

INDIANAPOLIS (Nov 1, 2022) –Inobat Auto (InoBat), a pioneering supplier of premium batteries for electric vehicles

batteries based in Europe, today announces that it has secured necessary regional incentives to progress the

development of its first North American facility in Indiana, which will create up to 80 full-time manufacturing jobs

focused on the green economy and power further growth in Indiana’s EV ecosystem. The planned100,000-squarefoot battery module and pack assembly and R&D facility in Indianapolis is a joint venture with Ideanomics, a global

company focused on accelerating the commercial adoption of electric vehicles (EV).

“We were thrilled to meet Inobat on our overseas business development trip to Slovakia earlier in the year and are

excited to now welcome InoBat and Ideanomics to Indiana to grow and scale their dynamic business for the US

market”, said Indiana Secretary of Commerce Brad Chambers. “With Indiana’s innovative economy and our push

toward manufacturing the products necessary for the energy transition, the timing is perfect for Inobat and

Ideanomics to open the doors in the Hoosier state.”

Construction of the facility is expected to begin in Q1 of 2023 and assembly to begin in 2024. The battery modules

and packs assembled at the facility could enable, at a minimum, 400,000 electric and zero-emission miles driven.

Both companies plan on continuing to explore the economic and technical feasibility to expand the facility’s

production capacity up to 2-3 GWh per year.

“I would like to thank Governor Eric Holcomb, Secretary Chambers, and the IEDC team who have been incredibly

supportive and worked closely with InoBat and Ideanomics over the last several months to bring this project to life,”

said Marian Boček, InoBat Chief Executive Officer. “I am confident that the State of Indiana is the right place for our

facility – it’s full of smart, talented people that I look forward to recruiting and welcoming to the InoBat team.”

Founded in 2019, with joint headquarters in Slovakia and the UK, Inobat has until now raised and committed

EUR91m from convertible loans, equity financing, EU and governmental funds. It is currently in its Series C round,

which will help fuel its expansion plans.

Ideanomics, which owns a minority stake in InoBat, retains the right to offtake battery modules and packs from the

facility for use in its Solectrac and Energica electric vehicles. Once Ideanomics completes the acquisition of VIA motors,

Ideanomics will also make InoBat’s battery solutions available for use in VIA vehicles as well. InoBat´s advanced, tailormade battery solutions are shown to provide a quick charge and higher density, often outperforming other commercially

available battery solutions.

“Across the EV industry, companies recognize that having secure access to high-quality and performance batteries is

critically important,” said Robin Mackie, Ideanomics Mobility president. “Together with InoBat, Ideanomics is creating

a resilient battery supply chain that can keep pace with our growing EV business. This joint venture helps guarantee

that we have access to a secure, consistent supply of the highest quality battery packs, modules, and cells, which

gives us a huge competitive advantage”.

To date, InoBat has two US based funding partners. The company signed a joint development agreement with the

International Finance Corporation to co-establish a Gigafactory in Europe and received an investment from

Ideanomics, which specializes in accelerating the commercial adoption of electric vehicles globally.

Based on the investment and company’s job creation plans, the Indiana Economic Development Corporation (IEDC)

offered InoBat and Ideanomics an attractive incentive package consisting of several forms of aid. This includes tax

credits, abatements, cash grants and training aid. All offered incentives are performance-based, meaning the

company is eligible to claim them once it made the investment and hired as well as trained local workforce.

InoBat to build battery gigafactory in western Europe,2022-04-06 00:00:00,"The Slovakian battery company InoBat Auto wants to build its third gigafactory for electric car batteries in Western Europe. A decision on the specific location is to be made this year. The company is also recruiting its board of directors.

According to the company, the planned factory will be located in the EU and the UK. The company believes that one of the reasons why the announced project is possible is the “successful validation of the performance of InoBat’s customised 622 and 811 battery cells”. This development, it says, has led to a sufficient purchase forecast “to acquire the first 4 GWh module of the 32 GWh project”.

With the announcement on the future factory, InoBat also announced that it had restructured its board, another measure to enable the announced project, InoBat said. The chairman is now Andy Palmer. InoBat had hired the former CEO of Aston Martin and COO of Nissan as “non-executive vice chairman” in 2020. Palmer now replaces Faysal Sohail, who previously held the chairman role and who will continue to be actively involved in the company’s development as chairman of the advisory board. Tara Lindstedt, Vazil Hudak and Kathryn Baker have also been appointed to the board.

“I’m delighted to announce our intention to start deployment of our gigafactories in Western Europe, which has been made possible by our innovative and hard-working team who have proven that our approach of designing electric batteries tailored to specific customer missions is a resounding success,” says Marian Bocek, co-founder and CEO of InoBat Auto. “Our new structure and Board will fast track the implementation of our ambitious platform for growth.”

InoBat Auto’s goal is to provide customers with customised battery cells for their intended use – using high-throughput screening (a method derived from pharmaceutical research) and artificial intelligence, the company aims to find the right cell chemistry for each individual application. The Slovakians have customers from the passenger car, commercial vehicle, motorsports and aerospace sectors in mind as potential customers.

The Slovakian company is planning a 100 MWh pilot production facility in Voderady and a 10 GWh factory from 2024. Some of the manufacturing equipment will be supplied by Manz. Most recently, Ideanomics, an eMobility company based in New York, had become an investor. The investment of an unspecified amount is intended to support the completion of the R&D centre and the pilot battery plant by the end of 2022. Other investors include Rio Tinto, Amara Raja and the World Bank’s private arm, the IFC.

Meanwhile, InoBatt has announced a collaboration with Gigamine, a technology-driven battery recycling company. Together, they aim to create a state-of-the-art process and supporting infrastructure for the cost-effective collection, processing and reuse of battery manufacturing materials and end-of-life batteries.

Recycling and the active reprocessing of materials to minimise waste and maximise the circular economy are key factors in the choice of location for the aforementioned planned Gigafactory, according to InoBat.
