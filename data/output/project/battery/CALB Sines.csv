CALB signs MoU for factory in Portugal,2022-11-04 00:00:00,"The Chinese battery manufacturer CALB wants to build its first European factory in Portugal, specifically at the port of Sines. The company has signed a non-binding letter of intent with a subsidiary of the Portuguese Agency for Investment and Foreign Trade (AICEP).

The news portal Euractiv has learned some key points of the plans from Nuno Gameiro, the CALB manager responsible for Portugal. According to the agreement, the first phase of the battery cell factory, which will have an annual capacity of 15 GWh, is to go into operation at the end of 2025. The aim is for CALB batteries to be installed in several European cars from the end of the first quarter of 2026. A tripling of production to 45 GWh is then planned by 2028. And: A possible third expansion phase is already being considered.

CALB (China Lithium Battery Technology) announced that it wanted to build a factory in Europe at the beginning of this year and had concluded a strategic agreement for the construction with Drees & Sommer, a consultancy firm for the construction and real estate sector with headquarters in Germany. At that time, there were indications that CALB was flirting with the idea of building in Germany as an “industrial base”. Now, however, Portugal is apparently coming out ahead of Germany.

CALB currently has seven production sites in Changzhou, Luoyang, Xiamen, Chengdu, Wuhan, Hefei and Heilongjiang with a planned capacity of 200 GWh for 2022. A year ago, CALB announced the expansion of its production capacities to initially 300 GWh by 2025 and later increased this target to 500 GWh by 2025 and 1,000 GWh by 2030.

According to an analysis by market research firm SNE Research, the group accounted for 4.1 per cent of the global electric vehicle battery market in the first half of 2022. With 8.4 GWh, CALB was the seventh largest supplier worldwide, according to the statistics.

Meanwhile, the group also completed its Hong Kong IPO in October, announced earlier this year. The IPO raised 10.1 billion Hong Kong dollars (about 1.33 billion euros) for CALB and was the largest IPO in Hong Kong so far this year.

CALB starts process for lithium battery unit in Sines,2023-03-24 09:05:26+00:00,"The Chinese manufacturer’s proposal defines that CALB’s future lithium battery factory for electric cars will be located in the Sines Industrial and Logistics Zone.

The manufacturer China Aviation Lithium Battery Technology (CALB) has already started the environmental licensing process of the construction project of the Lithium Battery Unit, in Sines, in the district of Setúbal, for electric vehicles.

At the end of February, CALB presented to the Portuguese Environment Agency (APA) a Proposal for Definition of Scope (PDA) of the Environmental Impact Study (EIA), whose public consultation runs until 20 of this month, on the Participa portal, for the installation of the lithium battery industrial unit in Sines.

According to the APA, the phase of defining the scope of the EIA, which is prior to the evaluation process and is optional, “aims to identify, analyze and select the significant environmental aspects that may be affected by the project and on which the EIA should focus”.

The proposal, consulted by the Lusa agency, defines that CALB’s future lithium battery factory for electric cars will be located in the Industrial and Logistics Zone of Sines (ZILS), managed by aicep Global Parques.

“The project aims at the construction and operation of a lithium battery production unit, on land that is part of the Industrial and Logistics Zone of Sines (ZILS)”, in an area of 100 hectares, read in the document.

The land “identified for the lithium battery factory has about 100 hectares”, and the installation of the production unit is “expected”, which will have “a capacity of 15 Gwh [Gigawatts]”, in an area “of about 50 hectares”.

The factory will be built “using technology aimed at protecting the environment and complying with applicable environmental legislation, also with a view to building a low-carbon industrial unit,” he says.

The industrial unit will have “a ‘Leed/Bream’ type certification”, using “renewable energy sources”, “water reuse” and “waste recycling”.

In a statement to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in November 2022, CALB revealed that it had signed a memorandum of understanding with a subsidiary of the Agency for Investment and Foreign Trade of Portugal (AICEP).

The agreement with aicep Global Parques included the acquisition of “surface rights, with the aim of setting up a world-class, highly intelligent, computerized and automated factory, with zero carbon emissions,” the company said.

CALB “has not yet signed a legally binding agreement”, so “the cooperation contemplated in the memorandum of understanding may or may not move forward,” he stressed.

In the memorandum of understanding, signed in November, in Sines, with aicep Global Parques, manager of ZILS, CALB demonstrated that this municipality on the Alentejo coast was “one of the privileged locations,” said, at the time, the mayor of Sines, Nuno Mascarenhas, in statements to the Lusa agency.

“Sines is one of the privileged locations for CALB, since we have all the conditions here, but it is only the first intention,” said the mayor at the time.

According to the China Automotive Power Battery Industry Innovation Alliance, an industrial association, CALB was in 2021 the third largest Chinese manufacturer of electric car batteries.",https://scantech.com/news/process-for-lithium-battery-unit-in-sines/
Mega Chinese lithium battery factory in Sines at risk,2023-07-04 11:46:40+00:00,"Massive project “could represent 4% of Portuguese GDP in 2028”

The project by Chinese group CALB to build a mega lithium battery factory in Sines, which could represent 4% of Portuguese GDP in 2028, is being reconsidered, reports Jornal Económico.

This could be a situation stemming from the decision to remove Huawei from the national 5G networks. As the online explains, when the decision was announced, China issued fairly blunt ‘warnings’ and it was widely accepted that Portugal could see retaliatory measures, like the “rethinking of investments” (for whatever pretext).

Equally, the CALB group (standing for China Aviation Lithium Battery technology) is having problems in China itself, says JE.

“In May, the group, which is China’s third largest manufacturer of lithium batteries, fired 2,000 young graduates it had recently hired, in a volte-face that caused controversy in a country that has the challenge of placing in the labor market a staggering ten million young graduates every year.

“The mass dismissal was justified by the need to make a “business adjustment” and the dismissed young people received compensation of three thousand yuan (about 350 euros.

“The Jiangsu provincial government opened an investigation into the case and the CALB group has been heavily criticized in the Chinese press and on social media.

“Another setback was the defeat in March in a lawsuit that had been filed by the market leader in China’s lithium battery sector, CATL. CALB was fined €3.7 million euros for violating competition rules”.

Jornal Económico says it has tried to obtain clarification from the CALB group, “but has so far received no response”.

Factory was to have covered 92 hectares in Sines Industrial and Logistics zone

As far as the online has been able to verify, a memorandum of understanding for construction of the plant was signed last November. Since then there have been no significant developments in the partnerships that CALB appears to have formalised with Portugal.

Some sources have told JE that “the Chinese side has not yet notified the Portuguese government about a possible decision to suspend the project, which was presented last year by the Minister of Economy, António Costa e Silva, as a decisive step towards the installation of an electric mobility cluster in Portugal.

AICEP too (Portugal’s Agency for Investment and Foreign Trade) has assured Jornal Económico, through an official source, that the project remains “active” (but without giving more details about its real progress, beyond what has already been reported.)

“The Chinese manufacturer’s project entered the environmental licensing process in February. On March 1 a contract was signed to reserve surface rights over 92 hectares in the Sines Industrial and Logistics Zone (roughly the size of 129,000 football pitches), managed by AICEP Global Parques. Production is scheduled to begin in 2025, with a capacity of 15GWh. At the end of last year, a company official told Lusa news agency that at cruising speed, between 2028 and 2030, the factory should represent around 4% of Portuguese GDP, thus surpassing the contribution of Volkswagen’s Autoeuropa”.

CALB itself described the project as a “world-leading, highly intelligent, computerized and automated factory, with zero carbon emissions.“

“However, in the same communication, which took place in the final stretch of its process of going public in the Hong Kong stock exchange, the Chinese company left the caveat that the agreement in question was not yet legally binding, so the project could go ahead, or not”.

Jornal Económico says it has “tried to obtain clarifications from the Ministry of Economy, but so far it has not been possible to obtain further details from official sources”.

Huawei decision “may lead to suspension of several Chinese projects”

Sources heard by Jornal Económico believe that if Chinese projects planned for Portugal end up being suspended, the suspension “will be presented as a decision of the companies themselves and not of the Xi Jinping government, despite the significant influence” that President’s Xi’s regime has on them.

And the suspensions may, in the final analysis, have little to do directly with Huawei. Chinese companies may simply fear that the Huawei decision is a flavour of things to come “at a time when other European countries, such as Italy, have raised barriers to the presence of Chinese capital in sectors considered strategic. On the 17th, the Rome government confirmed that it will intervene in Pirelli to limit the access of Chinese shareholder CNRC to the sensor technology of its tyres”, for example.

Says the online, “the decision to remove Huawei from national 5G networks, first reported by Jornal Económico on May 25, caused a small earthquake in relations between Portugal and China, as it contradicted several statements made by Portuguese policymakers in recent years and thus took Beijing by surprise.

“The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs took several days to react publicly to the announcement, having sent a note to Lusa, last June 8, stating that it hopes that “the Portuguese side makes rational policy choices autonomously and adheres to the creation of an open, fair and non-discriminatory business environment.

“Nonetheless, Major-General Carlos Branco and Ambassador Francisco Seixas da Costa have both told JE that the CALB issue, “and any other that may follow”, will most definitely be part of “a clear retaliation measure against what happened with the expulsion of Huawei from the national 5G system.

“It will be a retaliation that is not only expected but also understandable,” said Carlos Branco, who is convinced that retaliatory measures “will not stop here”.

Carlos Branco is a retired major-general of the Portuguese Armed Forces, and has in the past been described as both communist, and pro-Putin. He prefers to think of himself as neutral.

According to JE, the major-general believes “retaliation has a long way to go (…) We are making a clean slate of centuries of relations. Let’s see what will happen to Macau, to Forum Macau and everything that is involved there”, he added. And recalling that “the Chinese have projects in the context of Portuguese-speaking countries.

“At the University of Macau there is a chair (or whatever you might call it) on China and the Portuguese-speaking countries”. In other words, these are relationships that cannot be jeopardized by a decision by the National Council for Cyberspace Security regarding Huawei – which is what, in Carlos Branco’s view has been done, “with the utmost evilness”: “China’s vice-president, Han Zheng, was in Portugal a few days before the decision, met with António Costa and nobody told him anything”, Branco adds.

For Seixas da Costa, CALB’s decision is obviously “a retaliation” that was not anticipated because it was not wanted, says the online. This is despite the fact that the political analyst considers that the decision taken by the National Security Council “is part of a broader framework of a similar decision in the European context.

It is worth remembering that the UK was the first European country to sideline Huawei on 5G (in late 2020). Shortly afterwards, in February 2021, the House of Commons Science and Technology Committee published a report highlighting that the 5G process was rendered more expensive as a result, and delayed, says JE.

This is almost certainly what will happen in Portugal, too.

China´s CALB Sees ‘Opportunity’ for Battery Factory in Portugal With Xpeng-Volkswagen Deal,2023-08-19 10:01:30+00:00,"The new partnership between car manufacturers Xpeng and Volkswagen is seen by China Aviation Lithium Battery Technology (CALB) as “an opportunity” for its planned lithium battery factory in Portugal.

“CALB, which is in the top five of the world’s largest manufacturers of batteries for electric cars, is Xpeng’s main supplier and, through this agreement, also sees its European market reach new growth potential, highlighting its importance for the industrial unit that is to be set up in Portugal, in the municipality of Sines”, CALB said in a statement.

Volkswagen recently announced a EUR 630 million acquisition of a 4.99% stake in Xpeng for the joint development of electric vehicles. The two manufacturers want to forge a long-term and mutually beneficial strategic alliance, said Xpeng in a statement sent to the Hong Kong stock exchange.

Quoted in the statement, CALB executive Liu Jingyu said that as “Xpeng’s sole battery supplier“, his company “considers the agreement between the two brands to be the start of a new cycle of growth and success for everyone”.

The factory in Sines is due to come into operation in 2025, with the aim of responding to the company’s current order book on the European continent – and should be CALB’s largest factory in Europe.

The manufacturer estimates that the operation of the plant in Sines could “represent around 4% of Portugal’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP), since all sales will be exports to the European market”.

In March, it was reported that CALB had started the environmental licensing process for the project to build the lithium battery plant in Sines, after submitting a proposal to define the scope of the environmental impact study to the Portuguese Environment Agency (APA) at the end of February.

At the beginning of July, the head of Portugal’s Agency for Investment and Foreign Trade (AICEP), Filipe Santos Costa, told Público newspaper that CALB had gone ahead with a contract to reserve 90 hectares in Sines in order to proceed with the project to set up the battery factory.

At roughly the same time however, Jornal Económico, suggested the whole project was at risk, potentially in retaliation to Portugal’s stance over Chinese technology in 5G networks, and also due to the problems CALB itself has been facing in China.",https://www.clbrief.com/chinas-calb-sees-opportunity-for-battery-factory-in-portugal-with-xpeng-volkswagen-deal/
CALB to Build Its European Battery Manufacturing Base in Portugal,2017-06-08,"Chinese battery manufacturers have been aggressively adding production capacity outside their home country in recent years as they want to take advantage of the global trend of vehicle electrification. On November 3, CALB announced that it has inked a memorandum of understanding (non-binding letter of intent) with Global Parques for the establishment of a battery manufacturing operation in Portugal. It will be CALB’s first battery manufacturing operation in Europe. According to the memorandum, CALB will acquire rights to the land around the Port of Sines (the Sines Industrial and Logistics Zone) so as to build a zero-carbon battery manufacturing base.

Global Parques is a subsidiary of AICEP or the Portuguese Agency for Investment and Foreign Trade. Global Parques aims to attract foreign investments to Portugal by offering solutions for business locations, company registration, procurement activities, etc. It also manages industrial parks, sets up infrastructure, and transfers or leases space to commercial and non-commercial entities. On the whole, Global Parques encourages foreign investments by providing various direct and indirect services to international clients.

The Port of Sines is one of Europe’s major logistics hub as it is the region’s second largest deep-water port. It is also one of the few ports bordering the Atlantic Ocean capable of receiving the largest of container ships and has terminals for fossil fuels and a wide range of goods. Additionally, the Port of Sines is the largest railway freight platform in Portugal. More than 5,000 container trains make trips between the port and their respective locations in inland Europe every year. Hence, CALB’s new battery manufacturing base will be able to benefit significantly from the geographical advantages that this location has to offer.

Listed on the Main Board of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, CALB is currently seeking access to foreign capital and starting a new chapter in the internationalization of its business operations. The landing of its European battery manufacturing operation in Portugal is thus a huge step forward as the company accelerates its global expansion.

CALB currently has seven battery manufacturing bases across China. They are respectively located in the following provinces: Jiangsu (i.e., Changzhou), Henan (i.e., Luoyang), Fujian (i.e., Xiamen), Hubei (i.e., Wuhan), Guangdong (i.e., Guangzhou and Jiangmen), Sichuan (i.e., Chengdu and Meishan), Anhui (i.e., Hefei), and Heilongjiang. CALB also has more than 410GWh of production capacity in the planning phase. Once the overseas manufacturing base in Portugal is up and running, CALB’s will be able to release a considerable amount of new production capacity.

CALB’s major domestic clients are Changan Automobile, GAC Group, and XPENG. Regarding its major overseas clients, CALB has signed battery supply deals with Honda and Mercedes-Benz. Its first European manufacturing base will likely ship the batteries used in the BEVs under Mercedes-Benz Smart. With its IPO that took place this October and the landing of its European manufacturing base in Portugal, CALB is expected to gain pace in its global expansion.

Besides CALB, many other Chinese battery manufacturers have also announced huge plans to set up overseas production sites. They include CATL, Envision AESC, Gotion High-Tech, Farasis Energy, BYD, and SVOLT.

New Progress Made in Development of CALB’s Battery Manufacturing Base in Portugal,2017-06-08,"On November 2, 2022, Chinese battery supplier CALB signed a memorandum of cooperation with the Portuguese government. According to memorandum, CALB will build a major manufacturing base in Portugal as part of its expansion in Europe. Recently, new and concrete progress has been made in the implementation of this project.

CALB has reportedly initiated the process of obtaining an environmental permit for the planned base, which is set to be located in the Portuguese city of Sines. According to the reporting by foreign media, CALB submitted a proposal that defies the scope of the environmental impact of the project to the relevant regulatory agencies at the end of this February.

CALB said it aims to build a state-of-the-art manufacturing base in the local industrial park of Sines. The base will accommodate five plants that will be charge of producing Li-ion battery cells, producing electrodes, producing battery casings, and assembling batteries (battery packages). Spanning an area of 100 hectares, the base is set to have a production capacity of 15GWh per year.

Known as the “first gateway to Europe”, the port of Sines is a major logistics hub in the region. Its deep water port is the second largest in Europe and operates 24/7. The port is also the only one in Portugal that can receive some of the world’s largest cargo ships and is connected to the country’s largest freight railway platform. More than 5,000 container trains travel to and from the port every year, thus highlighting its critical geographical advantage.

The permit application that CALB has filed for the project reveals that the construction of the base is expected to take around 30 months, and the base is scheduled to enter operation by the end of 2025. CALB said the base will meet the huge and growing demand for EV power batteries from the European automotive industry.

Established in 2007, CALB offers Li-ion EV power batteries, battery management systems, energy storage solutions, and materials used in Li-ion batteries. The company is able to engage in technological R&D, battery manufacturing, sales, and application development. On October 6, 2022, the company was formally listed on the Main Board of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and thus obtained access to international capital.

Regarding CALB’s overseas ventures, the company has recently entered into a supply agreement with Forsee, a well-known French brand for smart battery systems. Together, they will be providing Li-ion batteries that power buses, trucks, specialty vehicles, and even ships worldwide. Also, in July 2022, CALB reached a strategic cooperation agreement with BMZ Group that also specializes in technologies related to Li-ion batteries. Through BMZ, CALB will be able to introduce its innovative solutions to buses, trucks, agricultural machinery, construction machinery, and other kinds of commercial power systems. In sum, projects and deals such those mentioned above are enabling CALB to accelerate its global expansion.
