Extremadura will have the first battery cell factory in southern Europe, a project to be installed in the Southwest European Logistics Platform, in Badajoz, with a total area of 177,000 square meters, a planned investment of 400 million euros and the creation of 200 jobs in the first phase and 500 jobs at the time of maximum production.\n\nThe presentation of this project took place in Mérida, with the presence of the president of the Junta de Extremadura, Guillermo Fernández Vara; the counselor for the Ecological Transition and Sustainability, Olga García; and the CEO of the promoter company, Phi4tech, Mario Celdrán.\n\nLikewise, the referential partner of the business group of the Energy Storage project for Extremadura, Alejandro Ayala; and the Secretary General for Industry and SMEs of the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Tourism, Raúl Blanco Díaz, who joined by videoconference.\n\nThe Phi4tech battery cell factory is part of a comprehensive energy storage project that also includes the extraction of lithium at the Las Navas mine, near the town of Cañaveral, next to a lithium transformation factory; nickel extraction at the Aguablanca mine in Monesterio; and the construction in the province of Cáceres of a cathode factory, in a place yet to be determined, with an investment of 200 million euros and the creation of 360 jobs.\n\nThe project is the private initiative of Phi4tech (battery and cathode factories), Lithium Iberia (Las Navas mining project and lithium transformation factory) and individual partners in the case of the Aguablanca mine. The project has financing, clients and project.\n\nIn addition, to these initiatives must be added the decision to locate the National Energy Storage Center in Cáceres, with which it is intended to collaborate in theoretical and applied research, and the implementation of an engineering postgraduate master’s degree at the University of Extremadura.\n\nRegarding the lithium mining project in Las Navas, the exploitation project and restoration plan as well as the environmental document that respond to all the determinations contained in the scope document are currently being drafted.\n\nThe total estimated investment is about 316 million euros (173 million for the lithium transformation factory plus 143 million for the mine and mining plant) with direct employment of 405 people.\n\nRegarding the Aguablanca mine, it is intended to reopen and extract nickel, gold and cobalt. When it is in full swing, about 350 people will be working in Monesterio.\n\nIn short, it is an integrating project that is already starting with a global investment of more than 1,000 million euros and 1,300 directs jobs, which indirect ones will have to be added.\n\nA new time for Extremadura with Phi4tech battery cell factory\n\nThe president of the Junta de Extremadura, Guillermo Fernández Vara, has pointed out that for the Autonomous Community “a new time is beginning” which means joining the industrial revolution of the 21st century and that “we really need it”.\n\nFernández Vara has assured that Extremadura aspires that its future does not depend every six years on how much money will come from European funds or on how it will be in the distribution of regional financing, but rather that it wants an “inclusive” project, a community that it receives from Spain and that it also contributes to the country’s economy.\n\nFor the Extremaduran president there is still a debt with the region “and that is that we can fly with our own wings” and be able to “also compete in the industrial league”, while he has assured that “a new actor arrives” who is tired of give an image that “has nothing to do with Extremadura today.”\n\nHe has repeated that he is a new actor who arrives with great enthusiasm and with the aim of being “masters of our destiny”, for which he has resources such as industrial land, sun and water, as well as electrical power to meet the needs that are arriving and of the railway improvements that will allow an exit to the merchandise from the region.\n\nHe also stated that in Extremadura “we are not in a permanent electoral campaign” but working for Extremadura, Spanish people, without fireworks, and wanted to express “loudly” that Extremadura does not renounce anything, while advancing that there will be more projects that will be presented when they become a reality.\n\nThe president described the project presented as something “loaded with symbolism” and has had words to remember “many generations” of businessmen, politicians and citizens who have fought to make this possible, with a special mention for Juan Carlos Rodríguez Ibarra.\n\nGuillermo Fernández Vara, President of the Junta de Extremadura:\n\nWe do not need wings, but that they do not cut them off, and that they treat us in the same conditions as others when making decisions.\n\nOn the other hand, he has received recognition from the Government and the Ministry of Industry, without whose participation the project presented would “be impossible”.\n\nHe has also valued the role played by the University of Extremadura, which, he recalled, was born in 1974 and has not only allowed the children of day laborers to obtain degrees, but also a new generation of talented citizens who “capable of taking charge of our future”.\n\nThe Secretary General of Industry and SMEs, Raúl Blanco, has described this presentation as “excellent news for Extremadura and for our country”, especially at a time “so severe” in the health aspect.\n\nHe pointed out that the project began its journey about two years ago and that it is part of the strategy to accelerate the transformation of the automobile sector in Spain, while also underlining its importance as it is an initiative that will generate industrial activity and a quality and stable employment.\n\nExtremadura will host the first battery cell factory in southern Europe, with an investment of 400 million euros and 500 jobs, March 24, 2021'}...

Its capacity is planned to be scaled up to 2 GWh in 2023, 10 GWh in 2025 and, eventually, 20 GWh in 2027.\n\nPopular content\n\nThe cathodes for the battery cells will be manufactured at another manufacturing facility currently under development in the province of Cáceres, which is also located in Extremadura.\n\nThe construction of the two factories will require an aggregate investment of around €1 billion and will help create more than 1,600 direct jobs."}...
Article 3: {'title': 'Spain begins to build its first battery factory for electric cars', 'published_date': 'None', 'keywords': [], 'text': "Spain begins constructing its first lithium battery cell factory , and lithium extraction will commence in 2022. This step will minimize reliance on the Asian market and gradually lower the cost of automobiles equipped with lithium batteries.\n\nThe electric car presents not only the issue of autonomy and the obstacle of high-speed charging infrastructure but also the high cost of BEV automobiles. This is due to the high cost of lithium-ion batteries and significant investment in new technologies, beginning with the modular platforms on which these new cars are built.\n\nRegarding lithium-ion batteries, which are used by electric cars and most hybrids and plug-in hybrids, even though Spain is a prominent participant in Europe's automotive sector, European manufacturers have an alarming reliance on Asia. This is where most of the lithium extraction industry and the majority of the market for the fabrication of cells for electric vehicle batteries are concentrated, even though some of the batteries are assembled locally.\n\nIn Spain, there are automobile plants for Renault, Mercedes-Benz, Nissan, Ford, the Volkswagen Group, and the PSA Group. Spain is a significant vehicle exporter to the whole European market, and our country is producing an increasing number of electric vehicles. However, our industry remains too reliant on Asia to supply battery cells utilized in these new electric cars.\n\nConsider lithium extraction, and its usage in the construction of cells is already costly. In that case, the final price of batteries, and the ultimate price of this sort of automobile, are influenced by the additional transportation expenses. And now that we are in the midst of the so-called semiconductor crisis, it is more evident than ever that the principle of globalization is sound. Still, mismatches exist, and lowering reliance would be beneficial.\n\nThe situation as a whole demonstrates why Spain should produce batteries for electric vehicles. Not just for the sake of the whole European car market but also as an essential vehicle production hub for the entire Old Continent. Also, this might minimize reliance, lower costs, and assist the introduction of electric vehicles in Europe.\n\nMany suggestions for lithium extraction in Spain have been made in recent years, but these projects have not materialized for various reasons. However, in 2018, the business Lithium Iberia began investigating the feasibility of harvesting lithium in Extremadura. According to their investigations, there is a vein of interest there, and they have been submitting papers to obtain an exploitation concession since then.\n\nLithium Iberia hopes to have this exploitation concession accessible during 2022, allowing operations to commence in Spain in 2023. This means that Spain will be operating a lithium mine to supply its battery plant for electric vehicles in less than two years."}...
Article 4: {'title': 'Construction Begins for Spain’s First Major Production Base for Lithium Battery Cells', 'published_date': '2021-08-04 22:00:00', 'keywords': [], 'text': 'Various energy news websites have reported that construction started in June for Spain’s first GW-scale production base for lithium battery cells. The base is located in Noblejas, a municipality in the province of Toledo and within the autonomous region of Castilla-La Mancha. The main developer of this project is Phi4Tech, a company specializing in graphene-related technologies. The base is scheduled to begin pilot production before the end of this year.\n\nThis March, Phi4Tech and the regional government of Extremadura jointly announced the plan to establish an integrated industry cluster for lithium batteries. The Noblejas base has the advantage of being in close proximity to the Las Navas mine that contains lithium deposits. In Extremadura, mining company Lithium Iberia will build a refinery for lithium and a production plant for cathode materials. Additionally, there is a proposal to reopen the Aguablanca mine in Extremadura as this mine has deposits of nickel and cobalt. According to reporting by other media outlets, the Las Navas mine will be able to start supplying lithium to nearby battery production plants in 2023.\n\nCapacity building at the Noblejas base will be implemented in multiple phases. Before the end of this year, the production capacity of the base is expected to reach 300MWh. Afterward, it will expand to 2GWh in 2023, 10GWh in 2025, and finally 20GWh in 2027. The construction of the Noblejas base and cathode production facility in Extremadura (i.e., in the province of Cáceres) will entail a total investment of around €1 billion. The development of the two projects is also expected to create 1,600 new jobs.\n\nPhi4Tech and Lithium Iberia have also teamed up to build another GW-scale battery production base in Extremadura (i.e., in the province of Badajoz). This base will have a total production capacity of 10GWh and be developed in five phases, with 2GW being added each phase. Phi4Tech estimates that €400 million will be invested into the construction of the Badajoz base.'}...
