The funding will likely support Tesla’s plans for a massive battery cell factory near Giga Berlin in Grünheide.\n\nIn January, the Commission approved €2.9 billion worth of funds dedicated to a project called “European Battery Innovation,” which focuses on the research and innovation of the local battery value chain. The EU’s battery value chain concentrates on four categories, all of which Tesla falls under. The exact sum Tesla will receive in public funding has not been divulged by the Commission, though local government sources have noted that the funding will be in the “single-digit billions.”\n\n“The state aid framework for [IPCEIs] is based in principle on expenditure for research activities,” explained a spokesperson from the Ministry of Economic Affairs to Business Insider. “Investments in scaling are only recognized under state aid law insofar as the scaling is a result of research and development activities and itself includes an important research and development component. A general formula or similar for calculating the Funding does not therefore exist.”\n\nWith the European Battery Innovation project, the Commission seems hopeful that the EU will hold a strong position in the growing global battery industry, alongside China and the United States. Supporting Tesla might be a good step toward the EU Commission’s goals given the company’s extensive background, research, and developments in battery technology.\n\nTesla plans to build an advanced battery production plant to produce its 4680 battery cells near Gigafactory Berlin, which would then be used in vehicles like the Made-in-Germany Model Y. The EV automaker already received pre-approval for the battery cell factory for its Germany-based plant.\n\nDo you have tips to share with the Teslarati Team about Tesla’s 4680 cells or battery production line?

Article 4: {'title': '38 New EV Battery Gigafactories Planned in Europe', 'published_date': '2021-07-03 00:00:00', 'keywords': [], 'text': "Sign up for daily news updates from CleanTechnica on email. Or follow us on Google News\n\nOriginally posted on EVANNEX.\n\nby Charles Morris\n\nYou can’t build EVs without batteries, as Elon Musk acknowledged years ago when he announced plans to build the first of Tesla’s Gigafactories (and coined a new word). Musk and others have estimated that the world will need several dozen battery gigafactories once EVs begin to be produced in serious volume.\n\nIt’s not just a question of volume—geography and politics also come into play. At the moment, most of the world’s EV battery production is in Asia—an untenable situation for governments in North America and Europe that want to promote EV adoption and create green jobs. And of course, it makes environmental sense to produce batteries as near as possible to where the vehicles will be produced and sold.\n\nSo, the world will be getting a lot more gigafactories (and the word will be losing its capitalization). The scene is really heating up in Europe, where government and industry have mounted a major push to produce batteries domestically. According to a new report from the non-profit Transport & Environment (via The Next Web), as of May 2021, there were 38 battery gigafactories being built or planned in Europe and the UK.\n\nEV sales are poised for grand global growth, and as T&E reports, Europe’s strong domestic EV market, a pre-existing industrial base and high environmental standards put the Continent in the catbird seat to capture a healthy slice of the market.\n\nA look at some of the battery gigafactories in the works all across Germany (YouTube: Germany Trade & Invest)\n\n“Battery investments are booming thanks largely to the rapidly growing electric vehicle sales seen across Europe in 2020/21, closely mirroring regulatory requirements, notably the EU car CO2 standards,” says T&E. In 2020 T&E predicted Volkswagen would sell 9.6% EVs in order to hit its CO2 goals. The final sales share was 9.7%.\n\nOf the 38 projects in the pipeline, 17 have secured funding so far, representing approximately $30 billion of total investment. Ten other projects, representing another $16.8 billion, have secured partial financing, and 11 more gigafactories have recently been announced, but have not confirmed financing.\n\nSeveral national-flagged projects are underway—companies planning plants under public/private partnerships include Verkor in France, Britishvolt in the UK, Italvolt in Italy, Basquevolt-Nabatt in Spain, and Freyr in Norway. Not only European companies have benefitted from the largesse — Tesla’s Berlin Gigafactory received some $1.4 billion in German federal and state support.\n\nIf all 38 gigafactories make it to production, they could be delivering as much as 462 GWh worth of battery cells by 2025, and 1,144 GWh by 2030, enough to power over 90% of expected new vehicle sales in that year. According to Transport & Environment’s analysis, this would give Europe a 20% market share of global cell production by 2025, making it second only to China.\n\nHave a tip for CleanTechnica?
