Article 1: {'title': 'Morrow Batteries to build 32 GWh battery factory in Norway', 'published_date': '2020-12-29 00:00:00', 'keywords': [], 'text': 'The location has now been determined for the planned 32 GWh battery cell factory by Norwegian company Morrow Batteries for electric vehicles: The plant will be built in Eyde Energipark in Arendal in the southern Norwegian region of Agder. Construction is scheduled to begin in 2023.\n\nThe location decision was revealed in a report by Norwegian broadcaster NRK, according to which, Morrow Batteries had four sites to choose from. According to the decision now made, the “world’s most sustainable battery factory” will be built in Arendal and will employ at least 2,000 workers there, according to the initiators. The first of the four planned expansion stages, each with 8 GWh, is to be completed in 2024, as reported when the plans were presented in June.\n\nIt was now reported that the factory will primarily build batteries for the automotive and marine industries. The investment volume is to amount to five billion crowns, the equivalent of around 470 million euros. The project is being supported in part by funds from the EU’s Horizon 2020 research program.\n\nIn June, it was announced that Morrow Batteries would initially manufacture cells based on existing technologies. However, in the further expansion stages of the plant, “next-generation battery cell technology” will then also be used. The talk is of developing and industrialising new types of lithium-sulfur battery cells.\n\nBehind the new battery company is a consortium of several Norwegian players. The owners of the startup are the Norwegian energy group Agder Energi and the major entrepreneur Bjørn Rune Gjelstens, who owns, among other things, the waste company Noah AS. The initiator is the environmental organization Bellona, which also has a small stake in the company. The project’s partners also include the research institute SINTEF, the business development company Innovation Norway, the so-called Eyde cluster and several raw material suppliers.\n\nMorrow Batteries wants to profit from the upcoming boom in the electric car sector and at the same time prove that battery cell production can be a sustainable industry. The company already emphasised this when it presented the project in June: “We need to build alternative industries to oil and gas and be able to initiate a green turnaround,” Terje Andersen, CEO of Morrow Batteries, said at the time. In Agder, the initiators of the project have access to energy from hydropower, among other sources. For the lithium-sulfur battery cells, Morrow Batteries also wants to use scrap materials from the Norwegian oil industry in the future. The value chain is to be explicitly different from those in Asia.\n\nWith reporting by Cora Werwitzke, France.\n\nnrk.no (in Norwegian)'}...
Article 2: {'title': 'Morrow Batteries', 'published_date': 'None', 'keywords': [], 'text': 'The MRC is set to become a leading hub of innovation for the battery industry in Europe. With a team of 70 highly skilled researchers from 20+ different nationalities, MRC boasts expertise that Norway has not previously possessed.\n\nÂ\n\nStrategically located on Campus Grimstad of the University of Agder (UiA), MRC benefits from UiAâ\x80\x99s five-year project to build a world-class academic hub for battery technology. UiAâ\x80\x99s researchers and educators cover most of the value chains linked to battery production, and a brand-new study program focusing on electrochemistry is being developed.\n\nÂ\n\nMorrow and UiA share a common goal to build the Battery Coast of Norway, along with other public and private players. Our battery technology will be tested, scaled, and mass-produced at the Morrow Development Centre (MDC), located in the factory facilities in Arendal. This proximity between the research and development facilities is a unique advantage in developing new battery technology.\n\nÂ\n\nFurthermore, the production takes place with Norwegian renewable power, resulting in double environmental benefits. Arendal municipality in South Norway has secured large commercial areas around the factory site to attract supplier companies to Morrowâ\x80\x99s battery production. This will contribute to a sustainable and short-haul value chain for battery production.\n\nÂ\n\nOur research extends beyond our wholly owned centre in Grimstad to include a teamworking in a rented high-tech battery lab at the Institute for Energy Technology (IFE), just outside Oslo.\n\nÂ\n\nIn addition to our research, we collaborate with the IFE team on several R&D projects. Our team here focuses on component development and screening, specifically for electrodes, electrolytes, and separators, which lays the foundation for scaling up our battery portfolio. They also work in a characterisation lab to understand the batteryâ\x80\x99s degradation mechanisms and test our prototype batteriesâ\x80\x99 safety. IFE is currently installing a â\x80\x9cpilot lineâ\x80\x9d like the one in Grimstad, which will double our capacity for more extensive battery work across both sites.\n\nâ\x80\x8d\n\nOur R&D team in Oslo also maintains close collaborations with the University of Oslo and SINTEF Oslo.\n\n'}...

We will utilise 100 % clean energy in our battery cell production and target significant CO2 reductions in our supply chain. Morrow will also become increasingly circular as we allow for the use of production scrap and secondary raw materials into battery cell production. Through partnerships, we will enable the collection of used batteries for further recycling or re-use.\n\nLearn more\n\n(â\x86\x92)'}...
Article 4: {'title': '42GWh battery cell factory comes to Norway -', 'published_date': '2021-05-31 11:31:43+00:00', 'keywords': [], 'text': 'Norway – Morrow Batteries and Arendal municipality have finalized an agreement for the establishment of 42GWh battery cell factory.\n\nArendal City Council unanimously accepted the arrangement. The cell plant will be built in Eyde Energy Park, right in the heart of the Battery Coast. Morrow considered around 19 potential parcels of land before settling on Arendal on Norway’s southern coast as the location for their gigafactory. The deal guarantees access to about one square kilometre of land.\n\nConstruction start in 2023\n\nMorrow will start building the factory (first module) in 2023, with production of battery cells starting in late 2024. All modules, in total four, will be completed in 2026 and will demand minimum 315 MW of electricity.\n\n“The location allows us to build our facilities with minimal CO2-footprint and with minimal impact on the environment. We will reclaim a former land fill as a parking space for the employees and is utilizing already cleared land for the first factory module. The land is already regulated for industrial activities,” said Terje Andersen, CEO of Morrow Batteries.\n\nSupport by international experts\n\nExyte has supported Morrow Batteries in the concept design of the giga-factory, and will continue to support with further detailed engineering plans. Morrow will start the construction of the first giga factory module in 2022, with start of production end of 2024. Further 3 giga factory modules are planned with a total manufacturing capacity of 42 GWh.\n\nBattery cell manufacturing\n\nMorrow Batteries is creating a Battery coast in southern Norway with industrial partners. From raw materials manufacturing through recycling, a complete local ecology has been established around the battery value chain. The objective is to create and manufacture the world’s most sustainable and cost-effective battery cells. Eyde Energy Park is an ideal place to realize this aim due to its abundance of green and competitive energy as well as its proximity to a harbor and shipping routes to Europe.\n\nMorrow will also have a pilot factory in Eyde Energy Park for raw materials and cell fabrication. The development of this plant will begin later this year, with the goal of beginning production by the end of 2023. It will have direct transportation, raw supplies, and important market access. Furthermore, the Morrow Battery Innovation Centre is conveniently placed a few kilometres away on the Agder University campus, offering facilities to support the next generation of battery technologies.'}...
