Article 2: {'title': 'Gotion and InoBat outline key points for cell factory in Central Europe', 'published_date': '2023-09-19 00:00:00', 'keywords': [], 'text': 'The Chinese battery cell manufacturer and Volkswagen partner Gotion High-Tech has just signed a “pre-joint venture agreement” with Slovakian battery company InoBat in Berlin. The main goal is the operation of a joint battery cell factory in Europe, the construction of which could begin next year. The agreement follows a non-binding letter of intent between the two companies in February 2023 and a 25 per cent stake in InoBat announced by Gotion about two weeks ago.\n\nBut first things first. What is known so far is that the joint battery cell factory will have an annual capacity of 20 GWh in the first phase. According to InoBat, the decision on the location has not yet been finalised, but the focus is on the “Middle-European region.” Other than that, the company remains rather general: “The future gigafactory should cover an area of more than 100 hectares and create thousands of jobs.” The partners expect it to be fully operational by 2026.\n\nInoBat CEO Marián Boček lists “strong support from the state and state institutions in building critical infrastructure, construction permits and providing competitive state aid” as key factors for the investment decision and expresses that “Slovakia has the opportunity to fight for the location of the factory and thus be competitive in the field of electromobility.” The partnership with Gotion High-Tech is thus strategically important for InoBat in several areas.\n\nSteven Cai, board member and CTO of Gotion, comments that InoBat has impressed his company with its strong expertise in research and development of its own batteries. “This gigafactory is to meet the localisation demand from our European customers currently supplied out of China as well as our new customer nominations in Europe soon to be announced,” he says, without going more into detail.\n\nGotion supplies batteries to Volkswagen, among others – the Wolfsburg company has been the largest single shareholder since 2021. On the one hand, Gotion is a technology partner for the PowerCo battery cell factory in Salzgitter. On the other, it is also building its own cell production in Göttingen. So, the cooperation with InoBat is not the first European activity for the Chinese.\n\nThe plans of the Chinese-Slovak alliance had already become apparent. Two weeks ago, Gotion High-Tech announced that it would take over a quarter of InoBat. The duo did not disclose the financial details of the investment.\n\nInoBat calls the deal a “Gotion-InoBat-Batteries (GIB) transaction” and stresses that Gotion High-Tech has “committed significant capital and technology support to ensure and safeguard InoBat’s success of the GIB framework.” According to the Slovaks, this is the “first such major investment by a top tier Chinese global battery maker in a European premier startup with a significant portfolio of IP Industrialisation and scale-up projects […].”\n\nWhen Gotion’s entry was announced, it was already said to focus on localising the battery value chain for customers – with an initial focus on Central and Eastern Europe and developing “green battery materials” in Morocco.'}...
Article 3: {'title': 'InoBat to build battery gigafactory in western Europe', 'published_date': '2022-04-06 00:00:00', 'keywords': [], 'text': 'The Slovakian battery company InoBat Auto wants to build its third gigafactory for electric car batteries in Western Europe. A decision on the specific location is to be made this year. The company is also recruiting its board of directors.\n\nAccording to the company, the planned factory will be located in the EU and the UK. The company believes that one of the reasons why the announced project is possible is the “successful validation of the performance of InoBat’s customised 622 and 811 battery cells”. This development, it says, has led to a sufficient purchase forecast “to acquire the first 4 GWh module of the 32 GWh project”.\n\nWith the announcement on the future factory, InoBat also announced that it had restructured its board, another measure to enable the announced project, InoBat said. The chairman is now Andy Palmer. InoBat had hired the former CEO of Aston Martin and COO of Nissan as “non-executive vice chairman” in 2020. Palmer now replaces Faysal Sohail, who previously held the chairman role and who will continue to be actively involved in the company’s development as chairman of the advisory board. Tara Lindstedt, Vazil Hudak and Kathryn Baker have also been appointed to the board.\n\n“I’m delighted to announce our intention to start deployment of our gigafactories in Western Europe, which has been made possible by our innovative and hard-working team who have proven that our approach of designing electric batteries tailored to specific customer missions is a resounding success,” says Marian Bocek, co-founder and CEO of InoBat Auto. “Our new structure and Board will fast track the implementation of our ambitious platform for growth.”\n\nInoBat Auto’s goal is to provide customers with customised battery cells for their intended use – using high-throughput screening (a method derived from pharmaceutical research) and artificial intelligence, the company aims to find the right cell chemistry for each individual application. The Slovakians have customers from the passenger car, commercial vehicle, motorsports and aerospace sectors in mind as potential customers.\n\nThe Slovakian company is planning a 100 MWh pilot production facility in Voderady and a 10 GWh factory from 2024. Some of the manufacturing equipment will be supplied by Manz. Most recently, Ideanomics, an eMobility company based in New York, had become an investor. The investment of an unspecified amount is intended to support the completion of the R&D centre and the pilot battery plant by the end of 2022. Other investors include Rio Tinto, Amara Raja and the World Bank’s private arm, the IFC.\n\nMeanwhile, InoBatt has announced a collaboration with Gigamine, a technology-driven battery recycling company. Together, they aim to create a state-of-the-art process and supporting infrastructure for the cost-effective collection, processing and reuse of battery manufacturing materials and end-of-life batteries.\n\nRecycling and the active reprocessing of materials to minimise waste and maximise the circular economy are key factors in the choice of location for the aforementioned planned Gigafactory, according to InoBat.\n\ninobatauto.eu (gigafactory), inobatauto.eu (Gigamine)'}...
Article 4: {'title': 'Gotion and InoBat planning battery factory in Slovakia', 'published_date': '2023-11-29 00:00:00', 'keywords': [], 'text': 'The companies have now signed a letter of intent to this effect with the Slovakian government. The partners had already presented the key points of the joint factory in September. However, the location was still generally referred to as the “Central European region”.\n\nAccording to the agreement, Gotion InoBat Batteries (GIB) will start building the factory in 2024 and the Slovakian government will grant subsidies, provide the 65-hectare site for the factory, prepare the building plot and ensure the connection to the power grid. Production is expected to start in the second quarter of 2026 and series production in 2027.\n\nThe Gotion InoBat Batteries battery cell factory is expected to have an initial annual capacity of 20 gigawatt-hours, which can potentially be doubled to 40 GWh. Independently of the Gotion InoBat Batteries factory, InoBat itself is planning a 100 MWh pilot production facility in Voderady and a 10 GWh factory from 2024.\n\nSlovakian Prime Minister Robert Fico sees investor confidence in the choice of location as proof that Slovakia is returning to the map of economically attractive countries. “Foreign investments are a necessary catalyst for our economy,” said the prime minister. “They bring not only capital but also job opportunities and technological innovations. Our government guarantees a stable and predictable political and legal environment and professionalism in governing the country. The arrival of foreign investments, job creation, technological transfer, and capital inflow into the country are, therefore, a direct confirmation of mutual trust.”\n\n“Supported by the government of the Slovak Republic and InoBat, Gotion aspires to establish this project as the foremost advanced battery manufacturing base and zero-carbon factory in Europe, and even globally,” says Li Zhen, Chairman of Gotion High-Tech. InoBat CEO Marian Bocek adds: “GIB represents a unique example of strong partnership between fast-growing start-up with the outstanding experience in project development and knowledge of Slovakian context and the technology leader capable of delivering a full range of technology and scale-up manufacturing capacities.”\n\ninobat.eu'}...
Article 5: {'title': 'InoBat provides operational update following significant 2022 progress', 'published_date': 'None', 'keywords': [], 'text': 'InoBat provides operational update following significant 2022 progress\n\nBattery manufacturing pilot line to be completed Q1 2023 with current workforce set to double when operational\n\nVoderady to act as R&D epicentre in Slovakia, supporting planned portfolio of gigafactories in Europe and US\n\nSignificant partnerships and MOUs signed over the last year\n\nClear progress made towards future growth plans\n\nLondon / Bratislava, 15 December 2022: InoBat (“InoBat” or the “Company”), the European pioneer of premium electric battery R&D, engineering, and production, today provides an operational update following the achievement of key development milestones this year and the significant progress made towards the Company’s future growth plans.\n\nIn summer 2021, InoBat began the construction of its EV battery R&D and pilot line facility on a brownfield site in Voderady, Slovakia. With a footprint of ~9,500 sqm, the site has progressed rapidly and now encompasses state-of-the-art laboratories, a dedicated R&D centre and a manufacturing pilot line, all on track to be commissioned in Q1 2023. The facility will be the epicentre of InoBat’s agile approach to product development, providing an “all-in-one” location solution – from chemistry research and cell development to battery production and recycling capability. This successfully showcases InoBat’s “cradle-to-cradle” circular economy approach in support of the Sustainable Development Goals of the UN (SDG 2030), which heavily influenced the decision to use an existing site to house InoBat’s first operations, reducing the need for carbon intensive construction methods.\n\nThe facility continues to progress swiftly and is on track to be up and running as planned in Q1 2023, with the production of tailor-made electric battery cells for InoBat’s customers set to begin shortly afterwards. With customer orders already signed, the facility’s current employee base will more than double to 150 as the site becomes fully operational, with one-third of the employee-base remaining entirely focused on R&D and product development. The facility will benefit significantly from Slovakia’s wealth of engineering talent and the intellectual capability developed at Voderady will sustain all of InoBat’s future sites.\n\nThis is only the first stage of development, however, as InoBat’s modular approach will enable the scale up of the plant in stages to ensure its expansion is in line with offtake demand, allowing the initial ~45MWh per annum capability to grow to gigafactory scale in a considered manner. As well as ensuring future capacity can be added smoothly without interrupting operations, this approach will also support production flexibility and the future-proofing of InoBat’s operations as processes evolve.\n\nInoBat’s significant progress builds on the foundations that were carefully laid at its creation in 2019, with much of the past three years focused on investing in its own proprietary R&D, taking the view that European companies must develop their own ideas if they are to compete with established international manufacturers in Asia. For InoBat, it has been key to take a customer-focused approach and concentrate on creating the right product for customer needs before building very large, giga scale manufacturing facilities. Collaboration is key for success and, importantly, InoBat has already signed customer agreements with players in the commercial vehicle industry and the electric vertical take-off and landing aircraft sector, with the first cells already shipped and $2 million of initial revenues realised. In addition, InoBat benefits from an extensive further pipeline and is currently in discussions with 30+ parties.\n\nMarian Bocek, CEO of InoBat Auto, commented: “I am incredibly pleased with the progress that has been made since we began developing our Voderady site just over a year ago. What was once a disused building is now an advanced research, development, and production facility with a top calibre R&D and operations team, all sitting under one roof.\n\n“At the heart of our success is InoBat’s truly differentiated approach to produce tailor-made EV battery solutions, understanding that no two customers’ needs are alike. Our bespoke batteries provide customers with longer range, longer lifecycle, higher energy density and faster charging time – and most importantly, we develop our products first before scaling up our manufacturing capability. With tailor-made products for key customers under our belt, supported by an excellent R&D and operational team, we have all we need to succeed and will continue to drive forward on our journey to become a leading player in green mobility.”\n\nThe significant progress of InoBat’s Voderady facility is just the first operational step towards a global ambition to drive the transition towards EV mobility whilst localising value-chains through local partnerships and alliances. InoBat currently has a portfolio of projects under development in Europe and the US with plans that will see InoBat develop a network of sites and, eventually, gigafactories, with local partners. This important step began in June 2022, when InoBat announced plans – along with cornerstone investor, Ideanomics, and the State of Indiana – to develop a new facility in Indiana. This was swiftly followed by the announcement of InoBat’s planned site in Serbia, with support from the Government of Serbia and IFC. InoBat will also soon be announcing the location of the company’s third gigafactory, planned for Western Europe, with declarations of intent signed with authorities in Spain although other locations, such as the UK, remain under consideration.\n\nThese three gigafactories – one in Eastern Europe (Serbia), one in Western Europe (location to be confirmed) and one in the US (Indiana) – will all be developed in a phased approach aligned with offtake demand, in 4GWh modules until they reach full-scale gigafactories. These future facilities will be supported by the intellectual capability produced at InoBat’s existing Voderady site as well as its first UK site at the University of Warwick Science Park’s Warwick Innovation Centre.\n\nNOTES TO EDITORS\n\nAbout InoBat\n\nInoBat specialises in pioneering research, development, manufacture, supply, recycling, and ultimate careful disposal of innovative electric batteries custom-designed to meet the specific requirements of global mainstream and specialist OEMs within the automotive, commercial vehicle, motorsport, and aerospace sectors.\n\nInoBat provides innovative solutions across the entire value chain thanks to its “cradle-to-cradle” approach, which showcases the concept of a circular economy.
