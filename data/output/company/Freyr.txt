The cells are to be sold for making Battery Energy Storage Systems. The project seeks to implement an innovative manufacturing process technology under a technology license agreement that will allow higher resource and energy efficiencies compared to conventional technologies. By the use of renewable power, the project aims to produce battery cells with the lowest carbon footprint. The promoter aims to use sustainably sourced and traceable materials. The project's core strategy is to develop a European battery industry and accelerate the decarbonisation of energy and transportation systems.\n\nObjectives\n\nThe project concerns the manufacturing of a new type of advanced li-ion electrodes and battery cells and could make a substantial contribution to the development of a European battery industry. The objective is to cater for the energy transition by supplying the growing demand for Battery Energy Storage Systems with cutting-edge battery cells that offer higher energy density, longer lifetime, improved safety, lower cost, sustainably sourced materials, and near-zero carbon footprint.\n\nSector(s)\n\nIndustry - Manufacturing\n\nProposed EIB finance (Approximate amount)\n\nnot disclosed\n\nTotal cost (Approximate amount)\n\nnot disclosed\n\nEnvironmental aspects\n\nThe project concerns capital investments for the production of lithium-ion electrodes, cells and batteries, falling under the EIA Directive 2014/52/EU amending the EIA Directive 2011/92/EU. All environmental, health and safety issues including environmental and operational authorisations will be reviewed during the due diligence process.\n\nProcurement\n\nThe Promoter has been assessed by the EIB as being a private company not subject to EU rules on public procurement or concessions. However, if at the project appraisal, the EIB were to conclude that the Promoter is subject to the EU public procurement legislation then the Bank would duly inform the Commission Services and would require the Promoter to apply those rules.\n\nStatus\n\nUnder appraisal - 5/01/2022"}...

Article 4: {'title': 'Norway’s FREYR Battery gets €100 million EU grant for Giga Arctic factory', 'published_date': '2023-07-14 10:51:43+00:00', 'keywords': [], 'text': 'This week the EU announced that a total of €3.6 billion is being awarded to 41 so-called large-scale projects through the fund’s latest round. That includes €800 million for clean energy tech manufacturing projects, of which FREYR Battery’s Giga Arctic facility in Norway is one.\n\n“With investments in innovative solutions like these, we deliver on Europe’s green transition goals, support our industry, and bring energy security, safety and prosperity to future generations,” Frans Timmermans, executive VP for the EU’s European Green Deal, said of the “unprecedented investment”.\n\nThe money is coming from emissions trading revenues within the EU, and Timmermans said that with the price being put on carbon emissions, “Europe is getting the additional financial firepower that enables these transformative investments”.\n\nFREYR has claimed its planned network of factories will produce some of the cleanest and most sustainable lithium-ion batteries on the market, targeting annual production capacity of 50GWh by 2024 and 200GWh by 2030. The battery cells will be based on the semi-solid electrode technology platform developed by US startup 24M. FREYR is also targeting building a sizeable factory in Georgia, US.\n\nAccording to an interview with CEO Tom Jensen for this site last year, as much as half of FREYR’s cells could be sold into the stationary energy storage system (ESS) segment, with offtakers to include Nidec ASI, with which the Norwegian company has formed a joint venture (JV).\n\nThe NYSE-listed company raised over a quarter of a billion dollars last year in a public offering, and appears to have been successful in raising investment for its plans, although the Scandinavian battery startup with the most prolific track record of raising investment is likely still Northvolt.\n\nNorthvolt was also among recipients of grants from the EU Innovation Fund’s total €38 billion pot, with its ESS factory in Gdansk, Poland, selected last summer along with 16 other winners.\n\nOther winners in the latest round include BASF’s recycling facility which the German chemicals company is co-locating with a cathode manufacturing plant. Groundbreaking was held on the cathode plant recently, with dignitaries in attendance including European Commission VP Maroš Šefčovič, who coordinates the EU Battery Alliance manufacturing and value chain initiative.\n\nEnergy-Storage.news heard at the tail end of 2022 that although Europe had held a strong head start on the US in terms of getting domestic battery manufacturing plants online, the impact of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) in the US had been a key driver in seeing that trend reverse somewhat.'}...
