Article 1: {'title': 'QuantumScape to open second pilot plant', 'published_date': '2021-03-25 00:00:00', 'keywords': [], 'text': 'Solid-state battery specialist QuantumScape plans to issue 13 million new shares. The expected proceeds of $859 million are to be invested in the company’s planned pilot plant and in the joint venture with Volkswagen. In connection with the joint venture, there is also talk of a second pilot plant.\n\nSpecifically, QuantumScape intends to use the funds from the share issue (equivalent to around 728 million euros) to more than double the capacities of the QS-0 pilot plant in San José, California, which was announced in February. The solid-state battery specialist also plans to invest part of the proceeds in its joint venture with Volkswagen. In this context, the US-Americans are aiming for another pilot plant called QS-1 with a capacity of 1 GWh, which will later be successively expanded to a total capacity of 21 GWh for series production. It is not yet clear where this plant will be built.\n\nIncidentally, QuantumScape does not mention the new information on the pilot plants named QS-0 and QS-1 in its press release on the share issue; it is hidden in a long stock exchange notice, the “SEC Report”.\n\nQuantumScape made the plans for a pilot plant in San José public a few weeks ago when it announced its financial results. The plant, called QS-0, will be able to produce more than 100,000 samples of solid-state cells per year, the announcement said. An expansion of capacity by more than double would thus lead to an output of more than 200,000 samples. As is the aim for the QS-1 pilot plant, which is still without a location, pilot cells are to be produced first in San José and later cells ready for series production. In concrete terms, the latter should be possible in San José from 2023.\n\nIn February, it was still said that QuantumScape wanted to spend between 230 and 290 million US dollars (about 190 to 240 million euros) in the current year to continue the development of its solid-state battery cells and to build the QS-0 factory. After the new announcements from the stock exchange release and the new share issue, these statements may already be outdated. QuantumScape had already received fresh capital at the end of 2020 through its IPO itself and last summer through an investment of 200 million euros from Volkswagen, among others. The Wolfsburg-based company now owns a third of the California-based company.\n\nWhile QuantumScape remained silent about its technology for a long time, the company presented performance data of prototype cells for the first time in December 2020. Since then, it has become a little clearer where the journey is headed: According to the Americans, the technology can help improve the range of electric cars by up to 80 per cent compared to today’s lithium-ion cells.\n\nThe published results with single-layer pouch cells suggest that QuantumScape’s battery can be quickly charged to 80 per cent capacity in 15 minutes. Alongside this, the developer promises a remaining battery capacity of more than 80 per cent after 800 cycles, which means that “hundreds of thousands of kilometres can be covered”. In addition, the solid-state battery is said to be extremely fireproof and to function on a broad temperature continuum without a major drop in performance – even in cold temperatures as low as minus 30 degrees.\n\nQuantumscape claims it has succeeded in optimising the lithium metal solid-state battery through ten years of development work in such a way that all aspects from high energy density, fast-charging capability and long service life to safety and realistic operating temperature are guaranteed. Until now, the low cycle stability has been considered a major weakness of solid-state batteries. The core of the QuantumScape technology is a ceramic separator, which is supposed to remedy exactly this. In addition, the solid-state battery does not have a classic anode. This is formed from pure lithium metal as soon as the battery is charged.\n\nAccording to the Californian company, the cells tested were single-layer pouch cells with “thick cathodes” (>3mAh/cm2), which are analogous to the cathodes of conventional batteries. During the presentation of the test results, company boss Jagdeep Singh said that further development work will consist of converting the single-layer cells into multi-layer cells and then preparing them for mass production. This should start in the second half of 2024 with the help of Volkswagen. The Wolfsburg company will then have the right to become the first customer for the new batteries based on solid-state technology.\n\nWith reporting by Cora Werwitzke, France.\n\ninsideevs.com, electrek.co, techcrunch.com, ir.quantumscape.com, sec.report'}...

Article 3: {'title': 'QuantumScape And VW Are Selecting Where To Make Solid-State Cells', 'published_date': 'None', 'keywords': [], 'text': 'After a Scorpion Capital report claimed QuantumScape was a “pump-and-dump SPAC scam,” the solid-state battery startup could not seem to care less. It released on May 14 that it is in the process of selecting where it will produce with Volkswagen. Both companies currently have a preference for Salzgitter, a city that was mentioned more than one at Volkswagen Power Day.\n\nSalzgitter will be where the German carmaker will have its first 40 GWh gigafactory in Europe. It already houses Volkswagen’s first recycling plant, which started to operate in January. Apparently, it will be the company’s manufacturing headquarters for batteries. The recycling plant could source raw materials to the solid-state cell plant in a much easier way.\n\nThe joint venture between QuantumScape and Volkswagen will be called QS-1. Initially, it will have a 1 GWh production capacity. However, the goal is to make it reach a 20 GWh production scale.\n\nIt is not clear if Volkwagen included that production capacity in Salzgitter’s total of 40 GWh or if it will be in addition to the 40 GWh capacity it will already have. Considering QS-1 will apparently be just in the same city but not the same plant, we’re more inclined to the second hypothesis.\n\nThe QS-1 will follow QS-0, which is an independent enterprise from QuantumScape. The solid-state battery startup expects to be able to produce 200,000 cells. Its goal is not to be a manufacturing marvel but rather to supply engineering cells for prototypes. QuantumScape hopes to provide cells for a few hundred test vehicles each year with it for all manufacturers interested in them.\n\nAs Jagdeep Singh told Sandy Munro, Volkswagen is pretty aware that the deal with QuantumScape is not exclusive. Being an investor in the startup, the German automaker will also benefit from any success it has with its competitors.'}...
