Nevertheless, given how important and interesting this news is, we had to share it.\n\nThe Basquevolt project, which expects an investment of €700 million, got started two years ago in secret, and its main goal is setting up a production line to make solid-state batteries by 2027. The production capacity will be 10 GWh a year, similar to large projects of a similar nature that are being set up in China), and it’s expected to create 800 new direct jobs.\n\nThe consortium of founding investors in the project, led by the Basque Government, includes Iberdrola, CIE Automotive, Enagás, EIT InnoEnergy, and CIC energiGUNE, whose research has facillitated the creation of this initiative.\n\nThis Basque research center, CIC energiGUNE, provides Basquevolt with technological support based on more than ten years of research in the field of solid-state batteries. The research team there is led by Michel Armand, the “father” of the polymeric solid electrolyte. Specifically, the technology that will be applied at Basquevolt will be based on the use of an electrolyte compound patented by CIC energiGUNE.\n\nBasquevolt will initially develop technologies that include the patented polymer electrolyte compound and an anode with a high silicon content, which will help solve some of the challenges of solid-state batteries. The technologies to be applied by 10 CIC energiGUNE patents that have been licensed to Basquevolt as part of the launch.\n\nThis unique technology raises lithium batteries to a new level, supplying products to the market that have high energy density and are safer and more competitive, all while significantly bringing down the costs of manufacturing batteries with a manufacturing process that is more energy efficient and less expensive.\n\nIn sum, the batteries made in the Basque Country will offer greater energy density at a lower cost, which will allow for the manufacture of vehicles with greater range and a lower price. These are the two key elements necessary to guarantee a “comfortable” transition from fossil-fuel vehicles to electric ones.\n\nThis project is one of the two large initiatives in the Basque Autonomous Community to occupy a leading positing in the new industry of production and distribution of energy that Europe and the world are developing. The second project is the Basque Hydrogen Corridor.\n\nThe Community of Navarre is participating in the Ebro Hydrogen Corridor, along with the communities of Aragaon, Catalonia, and the Basque Country. Battery Packs Nabatt is looking to build an assembly plant for electric car batteries in Navarre, with the public company Sodena, as well as private Basque companies Fagor Ederlan and Ingeteam participating.\n\nWe hope to be able to speak about all of these in later entries. For now, we’ll leave you with articles about the public launch of the Basquevolte project.\n\nIndustrial News – 13/6/2022 – Great Britain\n\nBasque solid state battery initiative launched\n\nBasquevolt, an initiative of the Basque government with founder investors the energy companies Iberdrola and Enagás, industrial group CIE Automotive and research organisations EIT InnoEnergy and CIC energiGUNE, plans the development of prototype cells and the commissioning of a pilot production line in 2025, with a view to starting production in 2027.\n\nEnlit – 26/4/2022 – Netherlands\n\nBasque gigafactory can unlock the holy grail of energy storage says research boss\n\nBasquevolt, Europe’s first solid state battery gigafactory, is a huge challenge yet an even bigger opportunity, says Basque energy storage research institute head Nuria Gisbert.\n\nLast Updated on Sep 5, 2022 by About Basque Country'}...

The aim of the project is to set up a prototyping line integrating various digitalisation processes.\n\nIn this strategic project, Basquevolt will rely on Telefónica´s advanced services to provide the transversality required by this prototype-scale manufacturing plant, both in terms of connectivity and equipment, and in terms of professional services and cybersecurity in the IT and OT fields.\n\nThis prototyping line will have a robust industrial connectivity network perfectly adjusted to all the communication requirements of the machines both in the production process (LAN OT) and the plant´s operational systems, complying with industrial standards ISA/IEC 62443 and ANSI/ISA-95, using Siemens communication equipment from the Scalance family.\n\nTelefónica and Siemens´ industrial sector specialists and Basquevolt´s technical engineering and modelling team have been working for months on a solution that will host the critical systems that operate Basquevolt´s manufacturing processes reliably and ensure cell production.\n\nLikewise, the adoption of cybersecurity measures in the industrial sphere has been a fundamental point in the design of the plant´s digitalisation solutions. In this regard, through Telefónica Tech, a series of solutions have been implemented to protect the industrial perimeter, segment and restrict unwanted traffic, as well as to detect and respond to threats that may affect the Basque company´s end devices.\n\nThe first results of this strategic project are expected in the first four months of 2024.\n\nIndustry in transformation\n\nFrancisco Carranza, CEO of Basquevolt, highlights: "The cutting-edge battery technology that will be developed in this prototype plant requires an extremely robust IT/OT network that enables the control and management of devices, processes and infrastructure, ensuring continuous improvement in productivity, quality, efficiency and flexibility of our manufacturing operations".\n\nAdrián García Nevado, Director of B2B at Telefónica Spain, says: "This alliance with Basquevolt means for Telefónica to develop its digitalisation strategy of pioneering projects and is part of its policy of supporting companies in their transformation processes as a technological partner of reference". Thanks to the agreement with Basquevolt, Telefónica, through its various solutions, is positioned in a key sector such as solid-state lithium batteries, with a long history in the field of industry and sustainability.\n\nJosé Ramón Castro, General Manager of Siemens Digital Industries for Spain and Portugal, emphasises: "Siemens is committed to a cybersecure digital transformation of Spanish industry. Our goal is to guarantee the maximum robustness of facilities and communications networks to minimise the impact of any possible cyber-attack”.'}...
