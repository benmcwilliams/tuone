BASQUEVOLT battery cells can be produced through a more efficient less complex process, creating a 30% reduction in the capital investment needed per GWh in a gigafactory and 30% less energy used per kWh produced, compared to lithium-ion batteries.\n\nBASQUEVOLT expects to start producing its 20Ah cells by the end of this year as part of Europe’s ambitions to meet current decarbonisation targets. The batteries will support the use of electric vehicles, making them more accessible and affordable to a wider range of consumers. The company has also set a goal to start the manufacturing of solid-state cells by the end of 2025 at its 1GWh (gigawatt-hour) future facility in Vitoria-Gasteiz. This target indicates its commitment to scaling up its battery production capabilities.\n\nFrancisco Carranza, BASQUEVOLT’s Chief Executive Officer, said:\n\nToday´s unveiling represents a significant milestone for BASQUEVOLT and reaffirms our position as a pioneer in the European solid-state industry.\n\n“Our dedicated research and development team has successfully overcome technical challenges to deliver a cost competitive solid-state battery technology that offers a very high energy density. This breakthrough has the potential to revolutionize multiple sectors, including transportation and energy storage. We remain committed to further refining our solid-state battery technology and collaborating with industry partners to bring this innovation to the market, driving positive change on a global scale.”\n\nJust one year after its creation, with more than 40 employees from 15 different nationalities, BASQUEVOLT has assembled a team of international experts and local talent, fostering a diverse and innovative work environment, now working at full capacity in the development and industrial scale-up of the solid-state battery technology competing with the most advanced companies in the world.\n\nREAD the latest Batteries News shaping the battery market\n\nBASQUEVOLT, backed by EIT InnoEnergy, unveils Europe’s first innovation centre to develop 100% European solid-state battery technology, June 19, 2023'}...
Article 3: {'title': 'Iberdrola takes a stake in Basquevolt, the solid-state battery company', 'published_date': 'None', 'keywords': [], 'text': 'News Back\n\n2022-06-10 01:00:00.0\n\nIberdrola takes a stake in Basquevolt, the solid-state battery company\n\nBasquevolt, the Basque solid-state battery initiative, will begin production of battery cells in 2027 with the aim of reaching 10GWh capacity, after its creation was signed today. This is one of the main objectives set out in Basquevolt\'s articles of association, which include as founding shareholders the Basque Government, through the venture capital fund Ezten, Iberdrola, CIE Automotive, Enagás, EIT InnoEnergy and CIC energiGUNE.\n\nAfter two years of intense work and maximum discretion, Basquevolt is now a reality that will make the Basque Country a European benchmark in the development of solid-state batteries.\n\nThe experience of the companies that make up the initial group of investors ensures that Basquevolt is in a very important competitive position both in the battery race, where there are also important opportunities for collaboration, and in the storage industry, which is key to making progress in the energy transition.\n\nBasquevolt begins its journey of starting up the first production line within 4 years, supported by an investment of more than 700 million euros, and which will be able to generate more than 800 direct jobs.\n\nThe first phase of Basquevolt will be based at the Alava Technology Park, in the Marie Curie Building (Albert Einstein, 35), located just a few metres from CIC energiGUNE. The centre, which will offer Basquevolt its technological support, based on more than 10 years of research work in the field of solid-state batteries, has a team of researchers led by Michel Armand - "father" of the polymeric solid electrolyte-. In this sense, Basquevolt\'s technology is based on the use of a composite electrolyte patented by the Basque centre.\n\nThe promoters of Basquevolt are aware that liquid electrolyte lithium batteries are reaching maturity and that the next technological breakthrough to truly unlock the true potential of energy storage must come from the solid state. The company\'s initial targets are the development of prototype cells and a pilot production line in 2025, with the ambition to start production in 2027.\n\nSolid-state battery technology is the only battery technology that meets the most demanding requirements of the automotive sector in terms of performance, which is why it is becoming the strategic focus of the automotive industry. The advantage of solid-state batteries over liquid batteries is that they allow better efficiency, longer life and less wear and tear when recharging. Thanks to its technology base, Basquevolt aims to become the European leader in solid-state batteries.\n\nSpecifically, Basquevolt aims to develop - in a sustainable way - the best materials and battery cells to enable the mass deployment of electric transport, stationary energy storage - including hybridisation with hydrogen-gas systems - and advanced portable devices.\n\n15 years innovating with start-ups\n\nIberdrola is making this investment through its international start-up programme PERSEO. Since its creation in 2008, PERSEO has invested more than 100 million euros in start-ups that develop innovative technologies and business models, focusing on those that improve the sustainability of the energy sector through greater electrification and decarbonisation of the economy.\n\nThe programme has focused its activities on analysing business opportunities and technological collaboration with start-ups and emerging companies around the world, analysing 300 companies each year and creating an ecosystem of almost 7,000 entrepreneurial companies. This investment instrument currently holds a portfolio of eight companies.\n\nThrough PERSEO, Iberdrola carries out more than 25 real tests of technologies per year, which serve as a first step towards establishing a commercial relationship or partnership with start-ups. In addition, in the last two years the group has launched a total of fourteen challenges in which 700 start-ups have participated.\n\nBeyond the financial contribution, PERSEO\'s support to these companies has been key in defining their product and business, offering them its knowledge and access to Iberdrola\'s market. On the other hand, the work carried out with the start-ups has served our company as a technological antenna to find out where our sector is heading.'}...
