Article 1: {'title': 'ProLogium Announces €5.2b Gigafactory in Dunkirk France and Greets French President Emmanuel Macron', 'published_date': '2023-05-13 15:00:58+00:00', 'keywords': [], 'text': 'Specifically, ProLogium’s objective is threefold: to put down roots in Europe, to mass-produce next-generation batteries for electric vehicles (EVs), and to support the energy transition of the EU automotive industry, as ICE car sale will be banned by 2035. ProLogium will invest a total of €5.2 billion to set up a 48 GWh gigafactory and an R&D center, strategically located in Europe. The localization of advanced battery manufacturing will also be a significant milestone in French government’s green reindustrialization strategy.\n\nFounded in 2006, ProLogium has demonstrated its ability to produce solid-state battery (SSB) on a large scale. Its automated pilot production line was activated in 2017, and since then ProLogium has mastered the key to solid-state battery commercialization, with years of experience in various consumer and industrial electronics applications. Its proprietary technologies are protected by over 600 patents worldwide. With the gigafactory in Dunkirk, ProLogium will provide the European automotive industry state-of-the-art battery solutions produced with decarbonized energy. ProLogium next-generation batteries will enable better performance for EVs and will help drive the energy transition of the sector.\n\nSafer, greener, lighter batteries that charge faster\n\nThe technology developed by ProLogium may provide an answer to limitations faced by current EVs as it demonstrates better safety, durability, and faster-charge capability, all of which contribute to elevated user experience for EV drivers.\n\nProLogium replaces the fragile and flammable separator and liquid electrolyte in current LIBs with robust ceramic separator and uninflammable solid-state electrolyte. With improved safety, ProLogium’s solid-state battery allows for the use of highly active cathode and anode materials, thus enabling higher energy density, which means longer range for EV drivers. Solid-state battery can also reduce the time for EV recharge to a level similar to the time it takes to refuel an ICE car.\n\nProLogium is also dedicated to making batteries for a greener future. Leveraging the proprietary solid structure and stable chemical properties of its solid-state electrolyte, ProLogium developed the patented “original-phase recycling” technology, a streamlined process to recycle a higher proportion of solid-state electrolyte with lower energy consumption. From recovery to reuse, the entire recycling process will help build up a sustainable circular economy for the local battery industry.\n\nMoreover, the use of decarbonized electricity for manufacturing processes will further reduce the carbon footprint of EVs with ProLogium battery inside.\n\nProLogium gigafactory in Dunkirk will yield positive economic benefits for the territory\n\nThe city of Dunkirk was selected from a long list of over 90 cities in Europe following a rigorous review process for its well-established infrastructure and superb geographic assets, this region will allow ProLogium to benefit from a supply of stable and low-carbon electricity at a competitive price, thanks to various sources of decarbonized electricity that are or will soon be present in Dunkirk, first and foremost the EDF power plant in Gravelines, but also the future offshore wind farm and a photovoltaic plant. This project will be located in the port of Dunkirk, close to Northern European automotive manufacturing plants and the international shipping network. These features make Dunkirk an ideal location to realize ProLogium’s vision of implementing local supply and local manufacturing for European OEM customers.\n\nLocated at the heart of Northern France’s “Battery Valley”, the ProLogium gigafactory site will also enjoy the advantages afforded by a thriving battery ecosystem supported by robust research capabilities.\n\nProLogium’s project is expected to create 3,000 direct jobs and 12,000 indirect jobs for the local Dunkirk community by 2030. Scheduled to start production by the end of 2026, the construction is set to begin in the second half of 2024 once the public concertation, under the supervision of the CNDP, and permitting process are complete. ProLogium also plans to establish an R&D center in France as part of its localization efforts.\n\n“We were competing with the entire world and you chose France and Dunkirk. You trust in a country and an industrial site over the long term, and so we will be committed to meet the deadlines, the financing and everything that will enable you to succeed over the long term.” said French President Emmanuel Macron. “Thank you, well done and keep it up. You can be proud of what you have done.”\n\n“Today is a special day for our company as we announce our major commitment in Europe, and particularly in France. We would like to express our sincere appreciation to France and the people of Dunkirk for welcoming us to the community,” remarked Vincent Yang, Founder and CEO of ProLogium.\n\n“We are thrilled by the opportunity to set up our base in Dunkirk, a perfect location for us to localize our value chain and be close to our customers and markets. With steadfast backing from the French government and our partners from the battery value chain in Europe, we want to contribute to the development of the battery valley in Northern France and accelerate the transition to clean transportation with solid-state battery industrialization. This is in line with our vision and mission to drive the wide adoption of e-mobility and create a better and cleaner world for the generations to come.”\n\nGilles Normand, ProLogium Executive Vice President International Development, commented “Selecting an ideal location in Europe has been an intense year-long process. Over 90 potential sites across 13 countries were reviewed. The final choice has been difficult with 3 formidable final contenders. We are pleased to put our roots down in Dunkirk, France after comprehensive evaluation. We have felt a strong sense of support at every level of the French Government in the process led by Business France and the Minister of Economy, Finances and Industrial & Digital Sovereignty. We would like to express our special thanks to the Region Hauts de France, the Communauté Urbaine de Dunkerque and the Grand Port Maritime de Dunkerque for their continuous support, which has exceeded our expectations in more ways than one. Today marks the completion of the first phase of our project. Moving forward, it’s time to work with all stakeholders and the people of Dunkirk to make our vision of carbon neutrality a reality.”\n\nAbout ProLogium :\n\nFounded in 2006, ProLogium is an energy innovation firm focused on the R&D and manufacturing of next-generation battery solutions for EV, consumer, and industrial applications.

French President Emmanuel Macron is set to travel to Dunkirk on Friday and make a formal announcement, business daily Les Echos reported earlier.\n\nOne of the sources said the new factory - the fourth battery plant to be based in the north of France - would involve an investment of 5.2 billion euros ($5.7 billion) through to 2030.\n\n"It\'s a big bet for our region and we are winning it, with four plants opening starting from 2024," said the second source, close to the Hauts-de-France region around Dunkirk.\n\n"The idea is to create an ecosystem here, from the production to the recycling of batteries," this source said, adding the ProLogium plant was expected to create 3,000 jobs over time.\n\nMacron\'s office declined to comment.\n\nCarmakers globally are racing to keep ahead of rivals in producing cleaner vehicles, secure greater control over their supply chain and bring battery plants - an industry dominated by Asian companies - closer to their own manufacturing sites.\n\nRenault (RENA.PA) last month said it had entered a long-term commercial partnership with French start-up Verkor in Dunkirk to produce batteries for the carmaker\'s premium and Alpine electric models.\n\nAlso in the north of France, China\'s Envision AESC and ACC - a subsidiary of Renault\'s domestic rival Stellantis (STLAM.MI), TotalEnergies (TTEF.PA) and Mercedes (MBGn.DE) - plan to establish their respective battery plants.\n\nThe three plants already announced are expected to help create 5,500 jobs.\n\n($1 = 0.9084 euros)\n\nReporting by Tassilo Hummel; Editing by Benoit Van Overstraeten\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.'}...
Article 3: {'title': 'ProLogium Introduces 2nd-Gen Solid-State Battery, Porsche Consolidates Battery Production', 'published_date': '2023-06-18 00:00:00', 'keywords': [], 'text': "Sign up for daily news updates from CleanTechnica on email. Or follow us on Google News\n\nees Europe is an annual event that brings together battery and energy storage specialists from all around the world. Last week at ees 2023 in Munich, ProLogium introduced its second-generation solid-state battery, which is claims can create packs that have double the energy density of traditional packs that use conventional lithium-ion cylindrical cells. Increasing the size of the battery to reduce the number of cells in a pack is an effective way to optimize the configuration of battery pack, the company says.\n\nProLogium calls its next-generation solid-state product a “large footprint lithium ceramic battery,” or LLCB for short. The concept is similar to the thinking behind the Tesla 4680 cylindrical cells — more energy storage medium + less packaging = higher energy density. Unlike the 4680 cells, however, the ProLogium solution is a large rectangular cell that dwarfs conventional cylindrical cells. See the graphic above for a visual comparison.\n\nIn May, the Taiwanese company announced it will build its first overseas solid-state battery factory in Dunkirk, France, this year. That factory will require an investment of €5.2 billion and have a total planned capacity of 48 GWh a year once all phases of the project are completed. The Dunkirk factory will serve as a manufacturing base to supply the European EV market, enabling ProLogium to mass produce its next-generation solid-state batteries and localize its R&D and supply chain ahead of its competitors.\n\n“With a clear roadmap for capacity ramp-up and technology development, we are making an all-out effort to accelerate the electrification revolution by providing improved energy solutions to our partners,” said Vincent Yang, CEO and founder of ProLogium Technology. “Last year, we announced the first solid state battery with 100% silicon oxide anode designed to enable higher energy density at the cell level. Now, we are pleased to present the LLCB, another pioneering battery concept that will take EV battery design to the next level in terms of long range, light weight and design flexibility. ”\n\nThanks to the unique structure of its large-format solid-state battery, ProLogium says it has surpassed the limits of liquid type batteries in terms of surface area and capacity. Its LLCB allows for a reduced number of cells and the omission of parallel connections inside the battery pack. The simplified pack structure can in turn facilitate ease of maintenance and reduction of ownership cost. In addition, its flat shape and the excellent thermal conductivity of the solid-state ceramic electrolyte make the cooling system for an LLCB battery pack much less complex, which makes it possible to have more energy storage capacity within a given space.\n\n“In other words, the LLCB will enable greater design flexibility for EVs,” said Simon Wu, assistant vice president of ProLogium Technology. “For the same space as the mainstream 2170 EV battery pack, the LLCB pack’s volumetric energy density can be nearly doubled, and for the same total energy, the LLCB pack’s weight can be cut by up to 115 kg. More importantly, the LLCB production processes will produce less waste in terms of substrate materials, and the reduced number of cells will require less raw materials, which means increased sustainability and affordability.”\n\nPolun Cheng, the head of project management for the company, said, “ProLogium is currently cooperating with FEV, a globally leading engineering provider in the automotive industry and internationally recognized leader of innovation across different sectors and industries, to carry out verification tests of the LLCB and design applicable solutions. Samples are targeted to be delivered to European car OEMs for testing as early as the end of 2023.”\n\nAccording to ArenaEV, ProLogium’s claim that its LLCB battery pack doubles the energy density of battery packs that use current battery technology means that a Mercedes EQE 350+ could double its capacity from about 90 kWh to nearly 180 kWh, which would increase its driving range by 79% to 447 miles. Sharp-eyed readers will note right away that a 180 kWh battery would probably cost about double what a 90 kWh pack does, but if you are a Mercedes customer, that may not be a problem. Here’s a helpful video that explains more about the ProLogium LLCB:\n\nPorsche Charts Its Own Battery Strategy\n\nPorsche entered into a partnership in 2021 with Customcells to manufacture high-performance battery cells for its electric cars. The partnership was called Cellforce Group, and it planned to manufacture about 100 MWh of batteries a year. Now, Germany’s Manager Magazin reports Porsche has bought out Cellforce and has upped its goal for the new battery factory to 20 GWh a year — enough to power 180,000 to 200,000 electric vehicles a year. The new factory will reportedly require an investment of around €1 billion. Production is expected to begin early next year and increase over the next few years until full capacity is reached.\n\nIt has been widely reported that Porsche is intent on bringing battery manufacturing in-house, and building a battery supply chain that is largely based in Europe. At the present time, its primary battery supplier is LG Energy Solution. There are a lot of moving pieces in its battery strategy, however.\n\nCellforce entered into a partnership with Siemens in May that would focus on the entire battery development and manufacturing process. It also entered into several other partnerships, including a system for coating electrodes for high-performance battery cells from Dürr.\n\nWe do not know at this point if that news is related to the recent announcement by Volkswagen Group that it has perfected a new process for dry coating battery components. According to Der Spiegel (paywall), the dry coating process reduces energy consumption in the production of battery cells by 30%, which could lower the cost of electric cars by several hundred euros per vehicle. In addition to the coating technology provided by Dürr, Trumpf, a mechanical engineering company, is contributing its high-precision laser technology as part of a strategic cooperation.\n\nCustomcells apparently is doing just fine, though, after being pushed out of the Cellforce joint venture by Porsche. Electrive reports that it has agreed on a “project-based partnership” with the Californian battery developer OneD Battery Sciences located in Palo Alto, California. Together they will pursue the development and commercialization of battery cells for an unnamed automotive OEM. That OEM is General Motors (GM), according to Electrive.\n\nThe Takeaway\n\nIn 2022, Porsche manufactured 309,884 cars. If it has plans to sell 200,000 electric cars within the next few years, it seems safe to say the EV revolution is well underway. As for ProLogium, more energy density could mean longer-range vehicles, but it could also mean smaller, lighter battery packs with the same performance as today’s larger, heavier packs. There is no word on the cost of its LLCBs, however. To this point, solid-state batteries have promised many advantages, but low cost is not one of them.
