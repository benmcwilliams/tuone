French President Emmanuel Macron lobbied for the factory to beat other contestants like Germany and the Netherlands.\n\nBoth Germany and France sweetened the subsidy pot after the U.S. last year unveiled its major tax subsidies to boost domestic manufacturing.\n\nThe subsidies for Northvolt would be the first provided by Germany under Europe's TCTF programme, adopted in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine and expanded this year to support green transition projects.\n\nThe support still needs the approval of the European Commission.\n\nA second plant could also be constructed in parallel elsewhere, a Northvolt spokesperson said, including in North America.\n\nForeign and domestic companies have invested in Germany to feed its growing EV industry. CATL (300750.SZ), which has been expanding rapidly outside China, is ramping up production of its plant near Erfurt in Germany and BASF (BASFn.DE) is building a battery materials site in Schwarzheide, eastern Germany.\n\nU.S. Microvast (MVST.O), meanwhile, built a factory in Ludwigsfelde, south of Berlin.\n\n(This story has been corrected to say production, not construction in paragraph 2)\n\nReporting by Victoria Waldersee, Supantha Mukherjee, Andreas Rinke Editing by Friederike Heine, Mark Potter and Sharon Singleton\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."}...

Electric vehicle sales in the first quarter of 2021 rose by 140% compared to the same period in 2020. By 2030, this number is expected to be 15-25 times higher yet. Meanwhile, renewable energy has become the default option for new generating capacity in Europe.\n\nThe dynamics in play impact all corners of industry and society in an uncountable number of ways, but what is constant is widespread and tremendous demand for lithium-ion batteries.\n\nTen years ago, there was little conversation at all of Europe engaging in the enterprise of establishing its own battery industry to support this new industrial revolution. Today, that domestic battery industry is taking root â\x80\x93 valued in excess of â\x82¬250 billion by 2025 and a regular talking point of European politicians and automotive leaders alike.\n\nAlready today, itâ\x80\x99s almost inconceivable to imagine that at one time Europe never considered moving in the direction itâ\x80\x99s now taking, such is how quickly the battery industry has emerged into the fabric of new European industry.\n\nEstablishing a new, sustainable battery industry for Europe from a blank slate, as is Northvoltâ\x80\x99s mission, was always going to be a monumental task.

Local councils this week approved the draft development plan for the plant, clearing a major administrative hurdle.\n\nThe Swedish battery maker is the furthest ahead among just a handful of European players paving the way for a home-grown battery industry, with a large chunk of planned capacity in Europe to be owned by Asian players.\n\nTaiwan's ProLogium said on Thursday it had picked France as the location of its first overseas car battery plant.\n\nTo fund its projects, Northvolt is also preparing an initial public offering that could value the company at more than $20 billion, sources have previously told Reuters.\n\nReporting by Victoria Waldersee, Supantha Mukhjerjee, Editing by Friederike Heine\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."}...
Article 4: {'title': 'Northvolt rolls out Europe’s first ‘gigafactory-era’ car battery', 'published_date': '2021-12-29 00:00:00', 'keywords': [], 'text': 'Electric cars have gone mainstream in Europe – they accounted for nearly a fifth of all car purchases in the UK last month. Yet one piece has been missing up to now: European batteries.\n\nThat is now changing. On Tuesday night, Northvolt, a startup, produced its first lithium ion battery cell at a plant in northern Sweden. It is the first of a series of new factories that investors hope will allow Europe to carve out a big proportion of the electric vehicle market – and weaken the stranglehold built up by manufacturers in China, Japan and Korea.\n\nThe Northvolt Ett site will be the first European-owned plant to produce at so-called gigafactory scale. Gigafactories are generally considered to be those capable of producing enough batteries each year to provide about 15 gigawatt hours (GWh) of cumulative storage.\n\nOnly two large battery factories are operational in Europe, according to Benchmark Mineral Intelligence (BMI), a battery data company: a factory in Wrocław, Poland, run by Korea’s LG, and another owned by Korea’s Samsung near Budapest in Hungary.\n\nYet there are 25 gigafactories planned for the continent by 2030, according to BMI, as the industry races to keep up with soaring demand for electric cars. Nine of those are owned by Asian manufacturers, which control most of the global supply.\n\nThe UK is arguably further behind the rest of Europe, with plans for only two gigafactories. One will be a major expansion of a small battery plant in Sunderland by the Chinese company Envision, while the Glencore-backed startup Britishvolt is attempting to secure funding for a homegrown rival in nearby Blyth.\n\nLocal authorities in Coventry are trying to find a manufacturer for a third site at the local airport, but nobody has yet stepped forward – a situation that has cast a shadow over the prospects of the UK automotive sector as it strives to replace the declining internal combustion engine industry.\n\nSimon Moores, BMI’s chief executive, hailed Northvolt’s first cell as “Europe’s first gigafactory-era lithium ion battery”.\n\nDespite its startup status, Northvolt has gained heavyweight financial backing from Volkswagen, the world’s biggest car producer, and the investment bank Goldman Sachs. Its $2.75bn (£2.1bn) funding round in June valued it at $12bn.\n\nNorthvolt hopes to rapidly expand production at the plant at Skellefteå in northern Sweden to produce 60GWh a year – enough to supply batteries for a million electric cars. Commercial deliveries will start in the new year.\n\nSign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk\n\nThe startup already boasts contracts worth $30bn with big European companies including the carmakers BMW, Volkswagen, Volvo Cars and Polestar, the truck manufacturer Scania, and the energy storage firm Fluence. Carmakers are belatedly ramping up electric vehicle production to meet tightening emissions targets as well as the challenge from their US rival, Tesla, which has built its own battery and car plant in Berlin.\n\nPeter Carlsson, Northvolt’s chief executive and co-founder, said the production of the lithium ion battery on Tuesday represented“a great milestone”.\n\n“Of course, this first cell is only the beginning,” he said. “Over the course of the coming years, we look forward to Northvolt Ett expanding its production capacity greatly to enable the European transition to clean energy.”'}...
