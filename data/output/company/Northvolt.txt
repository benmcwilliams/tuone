French President Emmanuel Macron lobbied for the factory to beat other contestants like Germany and the Netherlands.\n\nBoth Germany and France sweetened the subsidy pot after the U.S. last year unveiled its major tax subsidies to boost domestic manufacturing.\n\nThe subsidies for Northvolt would be the first provided by Germany under Europe's TCTF programme, adopted in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine and expanded this year to support green transition projects.\n\nThe support still needs the approval of the European Commission.\n\nA second plant could also be constructed in parallel elsewhere, a Northvolt spokesperson said, including in North America.\n\nForeign and domestic companies have invested in Germany to feed its growing EV industry. CATL (300750.SZ), which has been expanding rapidly outside China, is ramping up production of its plant near Erfurt in Germany and BASF (BASFn.DE) is building a battery materials site in Schwarzheide, eastern Germany.\n\nU.S. Microvast (MVST.O), meanwhile, built a factory in Ludwigsfelde, south of Berlin.\n\n(This story has been corrected to say production, not construction in paragraph 2)\n\nReporting by Victoria Waldersee, Supantha Mukherjee, Andreas Rinke Editing by Friederike Heine, Mark Potter and Sharon Singleton\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."}...

Electric vehicle sales in the first quarter of 2021 rose by 140% compared to the same period in 2020. By 2030, this number is expected to be 15-25 times higher yet. Meanwhile, renewable energy has become the default option for new generating capacity in Europe.\n\nThe dynamics in play impact all corners of industry and society in an uncountable number of ways, but what is constant is widespread and tremendous demand for lithium-ion batteries.\n\nTen years ago, there was little conversation at all of Europe engaging in the enterprise of establishing its own battery industry to support this new industrial revolution. Today, that domestic battery industry is taking root â\x80\x93 valued in excess of â\x82¬250 billion by 2025 and a regular talking point of European politicians and automotive leaders alike.\n\nAlready today, itâ\x80\x99s almost inconceivable to imagine that at one time Europe never considered moving in the direction itâ\x80\x99s now taking, such is how quickly the battery industry has emerged into the fabric of new European industry.\n\nEstablishing a new, sustainable battery industry for Europe from a blank slate, as is Northvoltâ\x80\x99s mission, was always going to be a monumental task.

Local councils this week approved the draft development plan for the plant, clearing a major administrative hurdle.\n\nThe Swedish battery maker is the furthest ahead among just a handful of European players paving the way for a home-grown battery industry, with a large chunk of planned capacity in Europe to be owned by Asian players.\n\nTaiwan's ProLogium said on Thursday it had picked France as the location of its first overseas car battery plant.\n\nTo fund its projects, Northvolt is also preparing an initial public offering that could value the company at more than $20 billion, sources have previously told Reuters.\n\nReporting by Victoria Waldersee, Supantha Mukhjerjee, Editing by Friederike Heine\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."}...
