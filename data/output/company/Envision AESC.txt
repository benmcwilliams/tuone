Article 1: {'title': 'Envision AESC is building another battery plant in Spain', 'published_date': '2022-07-19 00:00:00', 'keywords': [], 'text': 'Envision AESC is now also planning a battery cell factory in Spain. This is part of a larger strategic agreement between the Envision Group and the Spanish government. The battery factory is to be built in the Spanish city of Navalmoral de la Mata and will be operational in 2025 with a capacity of up to 50 GWh.\n\nThe overall project includes a gigafactory for batteries, a digital net-zero centre, a green hydrogen plant and an assembly plant for smart wind turbines in different regions in Spain, according to Envision. The battery factory is planned in Navalmoral de la Mata in the Extremadura region of western Spain. Navalmoral de la Mata is located about halfway from the capital Madrid to the Spanish-Portuguese border.\n\nLike Volkswagen’s battery factory in Sagunt near Valencia, the Envision AESC plant is to be subsidised through Spain’s PERTE programme. In return, the battery factory will become part of the “VENERGY+” project, which consists of 12 partners from ten autonomous communities in Spain, according to the announcement. It will localise the supply of vehicle parts and components using advanced technologies and integrate them into the battery ecosystem. The possible funding amount is not mentioned in the announcement.\n\nThe battery factory is expected to create up to 3,000 jobs. Envision AESC does not give any further details in the announcement – it is primarily about the overall project. More precise time schedules, the type of battery cells produced there and also possible customers are therefore not yet known.\n\nOn the other hand, it is certain that the plant for the production of green hydrogen will be built in the central Spanish region of Castilla-La Mancha – here, too, there are no details yet on the timetable or the exact scope of the plant. Plants for the assembly of smart wind turbines are also to be built in Castilla and the Leon region in the north-west of the country.\n\n“We are fully committed to supporting Spain’s national agenda on net zero transition,” says Envision CEO Lei Zhang. “The creation of new industrial opportunities such as the Net Zero Industrial Park will unlock the vast potential of renewable energy in Spain and serve as a gateway to building a pan-European greentech industrial ecosystem.”\n\nThe battery factory in Spain joins Envision AESC’s growing list of battery projects: in China, the company is building a battery plant with an annual capacity of 20 GWh. A joint battery factory with Nissan in Japan was announced in August 2021. Plans for factories in Sunderland, UK and Douai, France (including for Renault and Nissan plants there) were last adjusted in 2021. Finally, this April, the construction of a US battery factory in Kentucky was announced.\n\nprnewswire.com'}...
Article 2: {'title': 'UK: Envision AESC lays foundation for Sunderland gigafactory', 'published_date': '2022-12-12 00:00:00', 'keywords': [], 'text': 'Envision AESC has begun the building works for its battery factory near the Nissan plant in Sunderland, UK. It will be the second UK facility for the EV battery specialist from Japan. Envision AESC also announced new details regarding capacities after reports had varied.\n\nOnce the new plant comes on stream in 2025, it will have an annual capacity of 12 GWh, writes Envision in today’s announcement. This is more than the 9 GWh the company had set when publishing the plans for Sunderland in July 2021. A few months later, in October, Envision CEO Zhang Lei named an initial capacity of 11 GWh, but already for 2024. But going back to the latest news, expansion, so far, has been forecasted as 25 GWh by 2030 and ultimately up to 35 GWh.\n\nThe type of cell AESC will be making for Nissan here has remained unchanged, with Envision saying it would produce its latest generation batteries with 30% more energy density. They further promise to deliver enough batteries to power 100,000 electric vehicles annually. They did not provide more details, and it remains unclear whether the facility will manufacture cells or also house the assembly of entire battery modules.\n\nHowever, Nissan’s presence in Sunderland and cooperation with AESC have been longstanding. Nissan Europe Vice President of Engineering Andy Marsh explained how the first Sunderland battery plant helped launch the 100% electric Nissan LEAF and expects the second factory to become “a fundamental part of our EV36Zero project, which brings together electric vehicle production, battery manufacturing and renewables as we drive towards carbon neutrality”.\n\nThe EV36Zero initiative is worth £1 billion to Nissan and Envision AESC with the cooperation of the Sunderland Council. As battery partner Envision pledged to invest £450 million (about €525 mn) in the UK’s “first Gigafactory”. Nissan, in turn, promised up to £423 mn to produce another electric model in Sunderland in form of an all-electric crossover model based on the CMF EV platform from the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi alliance. Nissan plans to create a production capacity of 100,000 vehicles per year in Sunderland.\n\nAccording to the Japanese partners, the announced projects will create 6,200 jobs at Nissan and its UK suppliers, including more than 900 new Nissan jobs and 750 new Envision AESC jobs at its battery plant. Envision AESC also says it will increase the above initial investment of £450 mn in the manufacturing facility to £1.8 billion “in a later phase”, the equivalent of around €2.1 bn, and today spoke of employing up to 4,500 staff.\n\nThe company is already known to operate a 1.9 GWh plant on site, built in 2012 under Nissan. At the time, AESC was still working as a battery subsidiary of the Japanese carmaker before Nissan sold AESC to Envision Group in 2018. Within the last nine years, “enough cells, modules and packs for over 180,000 electric vehicles in 44 countries” have been produced at the plant, most notably for installation in the Nissan Leaf and e-NV200.\n\nGlobally, the second facility is part of Envision’s plan to scale up EV manufacturing capabilities in strategic regions. The plant follows last year’s announcements to build gigafactories in Douai, France, the US state of Kentucky, Ibaraki Japan, and Extremadura in Spain. This brings Envision AESC’s total capacity to more than 150GWh worldwide and advances its commitment to reach 300GWh by 2026.\n\nnortheastautomotivealliance.com'}...
Article 3: {'title': 'Envision AESC to build battery factory in France', 'published_date': '2021-06-25 00:00:00', 'keywords': [], 'text': 'Chinese battery manufacturer Envision AESC is said to be aiming for a battery factory at Renault’s Douai site in northern France that will offer an annual production capacity of 24 GWh by 2027 and 43 GWh by 2030 in several expansion stages.\n\nThe news was broken via several media reports citing insider and a report by the French authority Commission nationale du débat public (CNDP). According to the report, of the total capacity of 43 GWh, a good half – 24 GWh – will be reserved for future Renault electric models such as the electric Renault 5. The investment volume is said to amount to around 2 billion euros. The plans will probably be officially announced in a few days at an event hosted by French President Emmanuel Macron.\n\nRenault has also announced a digital event for coming Wednesday, which will focus on the manufacturer’s comprehensive focus on e-mobility. The Envision AESC battery factory in Douai is expected to complement the recently announced Renault ElectriCity mobility industry cluster. The new umbrella company will combine the electric car activities of the Douai, Maubeuge and Ruitz plants in northern France and build 400,000 vehicles per year from 2025.\n\nEnvision AESC is linked to Renault’s alliance partner Nissan. Nissan had sold its battery subsidiary AESC to Envision Group in 2018, but still holds a minority stake of 20 per cent. At the end of May, it was reported that Nissan plans to invest more than 200 billion yen (just under 1.5 billion euros) in battery factories for electric cars in the UK and Japan, together with Envision AESC.\n\nBloomberg reports that the partnership with Envision AESC is said to be part of a broader plan that could also see Renault take a stake in French battery start-up Verkor. Talks on a third battery deal are said to be underway with ACC; a subsidiary of Stellantis and Total. Representatives of all the companies mentioned declined to comment to the news agency. Currently, Renault buys its batteries from LG Energy Solution in Poland, among others.\n\nAccording to the above-mentioned French authority CNDP, Douai is not yet fixed as the location for the battery factory. The coastal town of Dunkerque in northern France is also said to be in the running. The final choice will depend, among other things, on how quickly permits are granted and how the development prospects are assessed. Incidentally, all the sources mentioned only talk about the settlement of a “battery factory”. It therefore remains unclear whether it will be a plant for the production of battery cells or for the assembly of battery modules and systems. The former is to be assumed, since Envision AESC is known for the production of cells.\n\nfinance.yahoo.com, bloomberg.com, debatpublic.fr'}...

They are then laminated into pouches, effectively making a dry cell, before entering the injection process, where the electrolyte is added to help form the current between the electrodes. The cell is then heat sealed and stacked into magazines 4-cells high in preparation for the next stage.\n\nThis is all done in a specialist clean room environment, where our teams must wear full PPE to protect our products. Our product is in demand, so this is a high-pressure environment where fast pace is combined with complicated processes, so the ability to work quickly and carefully is key.'}...
