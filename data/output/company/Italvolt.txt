Article 1: {'title': 'Italy expands Europe’s first solar ‘gigafactory’', 'published_date': '2023-02-07 12:07:31', 'keywords': [], 'text': "Italy’s energy utility Enel inaugurated its expanded 3Sun solar panel manufacturing facility in Sicily, making it the biggest factory in Europe, officials said.\n\nLocated in Catania, the 3Sun factory is already one of the largest solar panel production plants in Europe and the first of its kind in Europe to mass produce panels that capture the sun’s energy from both sides.\n\nThe solar panel factory, which currently has a production capacity of around 200 megawatts per year, plans to expand its production of photovoltaic panels to achieve 3 gigawatts by July 2024, Enel says.\n\n“With 3Sun, we are practically demonstrating that in Italy, and therefore also in Europe, thanks to innovative technology, we can now produce state-of-the-art photovoltaic panels that are competitive in international markets,” said Enel CEO Francesco Starace.\n\n“Initiatives like this are what the future of energy will be built upon,” he added, stressing that Europe needs to invest in its domestic supply chain to increase its energy security.\n\nAt the facility, Enel will produce double-sided photovoltaic modules allowing the panel to capture sunlight from both sides. The technology increases the efficiency of PV cells to 30% while current technology has an efficiency of around 20%, the company says.\n\nThe total investment for the facility’s upgrade amounts to around €600 million, including €188 million through grants received from the European Commission via the EU’s pandemic recovery fund and innovation fund.\n\nEurope’s ambition is to decrease dependence on China, which dominates global PV production.\n\nItaly invests in clean energy to become European energy hub The government is investing in clean energy, in addition to gas and LNG, to become energy independent and become the energy hub of Europe.\n\nItaly bets on renewables\n\nThe new gigafactory is part of Italy’s plan to “become the energy hub of Europe,” said Gilberto Pichetto Fratin, the Italian environment and energy minister who spoke at the plant’s inauguration on Monday (6 February).\n\nAccording to Fratin, southern Italy is becoming central to Europe’s energy supply, both as a source of wind and solar power and as a gateway to receive gas supplies from the African continent.\n\nThe gigafactory is also expected to have a significant local impact, with the creation of around 1,000 jobs, and more indirect ones, according to Enel.\n\n“The regional government has already defined a strategy that focuses on green energy sources and is working hard to accompany this transition,” explained Renato Schifani, President of the Sicily region.\n\nModules produced at the factory will be sold throughout Europe, but the goal is to increase also domestic renewable energy production and to use them in Sicily and in the rest of Italy, Schifani explained.\n\nItaly currently relies on fossil fuels, mainly gas and oil, for about two-thirds of its energy mix, while renewables cover only one-third of the nation’s energy sources.\n\nThe government’s goal is to overturn this proportion, Fratin said, and to produce two-thirds of Italy’s energy from renewable sources in order to ensure greater energy security, with gas supplying the remainder.\n\nThe government envisages for instance major investments in the development of agrovoltaics, which uses agricultural land to place solar panels, with the aim of installing 1.04 GW of agrovoltaic plants.\n\nEU renewables strategy\n\nThe European Commission was also represented at the factory’s inauguration event, with the participation of Ditte Juul Jørgensen, its director-general for energy.\n\nBrussels gave a strong boost to renewables last year in the wake of Russia’s military aggression in Ukraine, Jørgensen said. This included a dedicated solar energy strategy aiming to double installed photovoltaic capacity by 2025, with a legal obligation to install solar panels on every new building.\n\nThis was followed by new fast-track permitting rules for renewables as well as a new solar industry alliance aiming “to create the right market conditions, so that our manufacturing sector remains competitive and brings jobs and growth to Europe,” she added.\n\nJørgensen also expressed concern about international competition, referring to the recent US Inflation Reduction Act. “Our response in Europe is our European Green Deal industrial plan, a plan to make Europe the home of pure tech and industrial innovation on the road to net zero,” she said.\n\nEU Commission launches industry alliance for 'made in Europe' solar PV The European Commission on Friday (9 December) officially launched the EU’s solar photovoltaic industry alliance, with the aim of regaining production lost to China and establish a “Made in Europe” industry.\n\n[Edited by Frédéric Simon]\n\nRead more with EURACTIV"}...

Article 3: {'title': 'Italvolt to build the first Gigafactory in Italy – Italvolt', 'published_date': '2021-02-15 15:38:00+00:00', 'keywords': [], 'text': 'Italvolt, founded and led by Lars Carlstrom, the businessman who has been pioneering the automotive industry with over 30 years of experience and a former founder and stockholder of Britishvolt, is poised to build the first Gigafactory in Italy. The factory is destined to become the largest of its kind in Europe\n\nand 12th in the world by size, with its 300,000 m2 of floor space and an initial capacity of 45 GWh. With an estimated 4,000 workers hired and 10,000 jobs created, the Italvolt Gigafactory is one of Italy’s most important projects in recent years, envisaging an overall investment of approximately 4 billion Euros.\n\nThe first stage of the project will be completed by Spring of 2024.\n\nThe first step of the project involves the identification of the area where the plant will be built, at the end of the due diligence activity currently underway on some selected sites at national level. To bring such a challenging project to completion, Lars Carlstrom has chosen Italy, the country renowned throughout the world for its excellence in creating innovative work in the field of technological research and for its long-standing leading role in the automotive industry at international level.\n\nThe new plant’s output will be capable of significantly contributing to the growing demand for batteries in Europe, mostly driven by the automotive industry, that will increase 17 times to approx. 3,600 gigawatt (GWh) by 2030, with an expected demand from the European Union of 565 GWh, second only to China’s expected demand of 1,548 GWh1.\n\nItalvolt’s Gigafactory will be designed by the Architecture Division of Pininfarina, the iconic automotive design brand that has just recently celebrated its 90 years of activity and is already participating in other similarly large projects. With a strong focus on environmental and social impact, Pininfarina intends to develop a new-generation, intelligent and responsible industrial plant by applying DFMA construction methods and by opening the building out to its surroundings, making it merge into the economic and social fabric of the region.\n\nComau, a world leader in industrial automation, with over 45 years of experience and strongly specialized in electrification processes, will be the supplier of innovative solutions, systems and technologies for the gigaplant. Comau will also see to the construction of the Research & Development center that will be home to academic and industrial partners committed to the development of the most forward-thinking technologies in the electric vehicles sector.\n\nLars Carlstrom, CEO and founder of Italvolt, claimed: “With its Gigafactory project, Italvolt intends to seize the historical opportunity for green industrialization that is affecting all production sectors across the board, with a socio-economic impact that will recharge the global economy.

I strongly believe that our team of highly qualified engineers and technicians will produce the most environment-friendly batteries not only in Europe but in the whole world. Our aim is to ensure the future of the automotive industry and guarantee that the supply chain be as green as possible, from start to finish. The socio-economic impact that this new green industrialization is introducing is a turning point for the world”.'}...
Article 4: {'title': 'The weekend read: EU solar manufacturing – The time is now', 'published_date': '2022-03-12 00:00:00', 'keywords': [], 'text': 'From pv magazine 03/2022\n\nPV veterans will remember with a heavy heart the relatively recent decimation of the continent’s manufacturing landscape, after Asian competitors outpriced and out supplied their European peers at eyewatering speed. However, as Europe remains one of the largest solar markets globally, deployment levels continue to ramp up, and sustainability issues come to the fore, calls for meaningful domestic manufacturing capacity to be re-erected have become increasingly loud over the past few years, and it appears that in 2022 they may begin to be answered.\n\nThe SolarPower Europe (SPE) trade group is one of many organizations determined to re-establish a homegrown solar manufacturing landscape. In a recent op-ed on pv-magazine.com, CEO Walburga Hemetsberger stated that the association envisions 20GW of PV production in Europe by 2025, covering the entire value chain, from polysilicon to modules. “This is the objective we set for the European Solar Initiative, an industrial alliance we launched in February this year [2021], which facilitates the redevelopment of industrial projects in Europe,” she wrote. As she pointed out, however, manufacturers must establish gigawatt-scale fabs to be cost competitive.\n\nState of play\n\nIn July 2021, German research body the Fraunhofer Institute of Solar Energy Systems (ISE) released its “Photovoltaics Report,” which details the current state of European crystalline silicon PV manufacturing, as of the end of 2020. Looking at the map, while solar-grade polysilicon production capacity is relatively well established, the rest of the supply chain has a way to go if it is to achieve a meaningful share.\n\nIndeed, according to the chart, Europe had 22.1GW of polysilicon production capacity in operation, but just 1.25GW of solar wafer production capacity, 650MW of solar cell capacity, and 6.75GW of solar module production capacity.\n\nLast April, the European Solar Manufacturing Council (ESMC), an association of European manufacturers and research institutes, said that at least 75% of PV demand in Europe should be covered by domestic production, while two-thirds of PV products produced in Europe should be exported.\n\nThis would mean building up 60GW of manufacturing capacity on the continent by 2026 – three times what SPE is calling for. The current trade deficit of €10.5 billion ($11.8 billion) in solar cells and modules could be converted into around €50 billion of PV production on the continent, said the council, which would create around 178,000 new jobs in Europe.\n\nDecarbonize Europe - Green light to new avenues for solar and storage pv magazine virtual Roundtables Europe 2022 will address European decarbonization for the acceleration of the continent’s energy transition. Solar and energy storage will remain central to the discussion, but we will also look across sectors to explore how they can be effectively electrified or supplied with clean energy. Join the event on June 28 & 29 for free.\n\nOf the €723.8 billion the European Union wants to provide through its post-pandemic reconstruction program – the Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF) – the ESMC says that €20 billion should be used to shore up the European PV industry. In a report issued in late December, it wrote that “to benefit from the support of the RRF, EU member states must submit recovery and resilience plans (RRPs), with the reforms and investments to be implemented by the end of 2026 … In ESMCs RRP evaluation effort, a total of €477 million have been identified as direct support for PV manufacturing. They consist of both loans and grants to establish or strengthen the PV value chain in Italy, Romania, and Croatia.”\n\nItaly is said to hold the largest direct RRP support for solar PV manufacturing, with €400 million dedicated to help reach the national target of 2GW annual manufacturing capacity by December 2025, said ESMC, while in Romania, €50 million has been allocated to develop 200MW of PV production capacity, and in Croatia, €26.5 million has been dedicated to the development of environmentally friendly production processes, including PV manufacturing.\n\nRamping up\n\nSome significant steps were made in 2021 to ramp volumes up, predominantly in Germany, with Switzerland-based Meyer Burger Technology AG opening a 400MW module and a 400MW cell factory at two separate locations in Germany last March for its heterojunction products. Following financing in July 2021 to accelerate its production capacities, this year is expected to be a “ramp-up year” with plans to increase its annual European cell production to 1.4GW and module production to 1GW by the end of 2022.\n\nThe UK’s Oxford PV also completed the build-out of its 100MW Brandenburg fab for its crystalline silicon heterojunction/perovskite tandem PV cells last July. It too expects the line to start full production in 2022 and CEO Frank P. Averdung told pv magazine at the time that it is in the “final stages” of a funding round that will allow the company to expand beyond the initial 100MW line up to gigawatt scale. “We hope we will be able to communicate the closure of the funding very soon,” he said.\n\nMeanwhile, in a recently announced partnership, Sonnenstromfabrik (CS Wismar GmbH) is expanding its 200MW module manufacturing operations in Wismar with the addition of a new 300MW line. The German company will use REC Group’s award-winning and patented half-cut cell and twin module and junction box design for the manufacture of two new PERC module products utlizing large format wafers.\n\nAnd on the wafer front, another German company, Fraunhofer ISE spinoff NexWafe GmbH – which manufactures high-efficiency monocrystalline silicon kerfless wafers – is gearing up to start commercial production this year, following an injection of €32 million in 2021, €25 million of which came from Indian conglomerate Reliance Industries Limited. In addition to manufacturing in Germany, Reliance will be granted access to NexWafe’s patented technology to utilize in its planned gigawatt manufacturing facility in India.\n\nWhile there are many plans taking place in Germany, Italy is also a hot spot for PV manufacturing, as the EMSC mentioned. Last November, renewable energy company and PV module manufacturer Enel Green Power (EGP), a unit of Italian power utility Enel, secured an undisclosed sum from the European Union to scale up its 200MW heterojunction cell and module factory in Catania to 3GW.\n\nSpeaking to pv magazine this January, new EGP CEO Salvatore Bernabei said the company is “planning to start the works for the enlargement of the factory soon. We will add a new building close to the existing one.” The factory is expected to begin manufacturing activities by the end of 2023 and to reach full capacity by mid-2024.\n\nA month later, Enel announced that Italian engineering company Comal is planning a 1GW solar tracker manufacturing fab in the power company’s Montalto di Castro power plant in Italy. The new factory – “Tracker Sun Hunter” – will see Comal manufacture trackers across an area of over 30,000 square meters inside Enel’s plant which is no longer used for energy generation.\n\nPopular content\n\nIn France, REC Group said in November 2020 that it is planning to build a 4GW PV module factory in the northwestern region of Moselle. Work was expected to commence this year; however, delays have seen this pushed back. In a statement released in June 2021, the company said, “REC Solar France teams and partners remain mobilized and are working hand in hand to bring the project to a successful conclusion as soon as possible.”\n\nAccording to the initial announcement, everything will be done on-site including the production of cells, assembly of modules, quality control, receipt of raw materials and shipment of finished products.\n\nSustainable path\n\nAs mentioned in the February edition of pv magazine (pp.74-77), Europe is also on a mission to establish itself as a key manufacturing base for batteries to support both the growth of electric vehicles and stationary storage projects. Over the past six years, ambitious plans have been announced to achieve this goal, with the latest predictions suggesting that 35 gigafactories will be operational by 2035.\n\nOne of the key priorities is to build a sustainable manufacturing industry. This is also vital for the solar value chain and something that is being taken seriously. As pv magazine said in the third quarter of 2020, as part of the UP Initiative’s Circular Manufacturing quarterly theme, the creation of a circular PV economy is an EU priority under its proposed Green Deal.\n\nFor example, the Circusol project, which stands for Circular Business Models, is an Innovation Action project funded by the European Commission’s Horizon 2020 program. It seeks not only to unearth new business opportunities, like solar as a service, but also to look at the redesign and recyclability of solar products, among other issues. A part of this consortium has seen Lithuanian module maker SoliTek investigate barriers and opportunities related to solar module circularity, to propose alternative design options. pv magazine will publish the results of this investigation during the second quarter.\n\nStating that now is the time to reinvest in the European manufacturing industry and take advantage of the TW-scale opportunities ahead, Germany’s Fraunhofer ISE established the Green Manufacturing Consortium in 2019. It is a German publicly funded project, comprising 20 industrial partners, four institutes and two industry associations, including First Solar, Meyer Burger, Total, Wacker, VDMA, Oxford PV, and Von Ardenne.\n\nThe objective is to develop an “economic-ecological evaluation methodology for a sustainable future factory for the production of innovative PV modules,” Jochen Rentsch, said head of the department production technology division photovoltaics at Fraunhofer ISE, in 2020.\n\nThe overarching goal of the project is to develop an economic-ecological evaluation methodology for a sustainable future factory – 10GW in size and easily scalable beyond that – to produce innovative PV modules. “Via a comprehensive energy and material flow model of scaled and vertically integrated PV fabs we will simulate changes in production capacity, factory layout, supply systems, production facilities and processes as well as recycling of materials through recycling processes and other value-added stages,” explained Rentsch.\n\nAt the time, Fraunhofer ISE Director Andreas Bett said reestablishing a European PV manufacturing market represents a “big opportunity” to ensure energy security by reducing dependency on imports, lowering costs, and addressing sustainability. “Why transport large and heavy PV modules the long distance from Asia and cause CO2 emissions and added cost? For example, module costs of €0.20/W can be soon realized, and transport costs from China to Europe can be up to €0.025/W,” he wrote.\n\nSustainability is also a key priority for both REC Group and Sonnenstromfabrik. Indeed, talking about the recently announced partnership, managing director of the latter, Bernhard Weilharter, said that producing low-carbon products is a central aim for the company. The journey started in 2016 when Sonnenstromfabrik began supplying the French market with certified low carbon modules. It now completes life cycle assessments for all its products, and in some markets it also secures an Eco Passport to back its environmental credentials.\n\nMeanwhile, REC Group not only produces its wafers in Norway using hydro energy, but it also focuses on upcycling kerf via a “unique new kerf processing technology” – during the standard wafer slicing process, around 30% of the silicon remains as waste, or kerf – to reuse it in cells and modules, said Agnieszka Schulze head of global PR at REC Solar EMEA GmbH. It further produces “polysilicon with the lowest carbon footprint,” she added.\n\nDecarbonization plans\n\nAfter a period of stagnation, the European PV industry is again stepping onto the world manufacturing stage. Thus, pv magazine will spend the second quarter looking at the companies acting to establish PV fabs, particularly those which are doing so in a sustainable manner.\n\nIn addition to revisiting the circular manufacturing projects highlighted in the third quarter of 2020, we will be looking at the challenges European manufacturers face, the advantages of producing Made in Europe solar products, and what needs to be done to convince political leaders and other decision-makers to jump on board.\n\npv magazine sees this transition as being crucial if Europe is to achieve its decarbonization plans in a sustainable way. This will therefore be a topic that will be addressed via the UP Initiative, but also at its virtual Roundtables Europe event on June 28 and 29. For more information, contact up@pv-magazine.com.'}...
